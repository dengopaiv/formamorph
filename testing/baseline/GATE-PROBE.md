# Heretic-vs-RP gate probe

Tests the **RP-finetune-only catalog policy**: do genuine RP finetunes actually beat general decensored
writers for Formamorph, on the same base? And measures how much of any advantage is our *prompts* vs the
*models*. See the upstream reasoning in [`../../docs-internal/notes/model-research/notes.md`](../../docs-internal/notes/model-research/notes.md).

## The matrix — 3 controlled pairs, base held constant

| Pair | RP-tuned (policy keeps) | General decensored (policy rejects) | Base |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gemma 31B | `meromero-31b` | `gemma31b-heretic` | Gemma-4 31B dense |
| Gemma 26B-A4B | `meromero-26b` | `gemma26b-heretic` | Gemma-4 26B-A4B MoE |
| Mistral 12B | `silver-siren-12b` | `mistral-heretic` | Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407 |

> The general-decensored Mistral control is `mradermacher/Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407-Heretic-v2-i1-GGUF`
> (heretic method on plain instruct — not a creative finetune). The originally planned `natong19` abliterated
> GGUFs won't load in current llama.cpp (Ollama **or** LM Studio): their embedded tool-calling template crashes
> llama-server (`selectattr: unknown test 'tool_calls'`). The Heretic-v2 GGUF has a clean template.

Each pair changes exactly one variable — RP finetune present/absent — so a gap is attributable to the tuning,
not the architecture. Modelfiles: `harness/Modelfile.*`.

## Two prompt arms (the agnosticism control)

- **A-arm (`gateA`)** — the shipped default prompts, tuned on the reference pair. The *ceiling*.
- **B-arm (`gateB`)** — the neutral control preset (`harness/neutral-preset.json`): the same contracts stated
  plainly, stripped of persona framing, worked examples, and anti-parrot tricks, with all per-prompt sampler
  pins neutralized to a flat 0.7. The agnostic *floor*.

The **A-minus-B gap** is each model's prompt-sensitivity. A model that only wins under A is fragile; one that
wins under B has real capability. Sampler baseline is a flat 0.7 everywhere (Modelfile default for the
non-pinned calls, the neutral preset overrides the four pinned calls).

## The scenario — one 10-turn run on the gate world

World: [`blackrue-waystation.json`](blackrue-waystation.json) — a mature-tone waystation with a hostile beast,
a consenting adult companion (Sable), and an intimidatable bystander (Pell), so one playthrough exercises every
axis. Full pipeline on: narration, choices, stats, location, precall planning.

| # | Action | Tests | Correct restraint |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | *(opening)* | prose, scene-set | none · NONE |
| 2 | brush road dust from sleeve | **no-op** (idle grooming) | none · NONE |
| 3 | talk to Sable | prose, dialogue | none · NONE |
| 4 | retie a bootlace | **no-op** (idle fidget) | none · NONE |
| 5 | cut down the road-wolf as it lunges | **gate: violence** + stat | Vigor↓ · NONE |
| 6 | keep fighting, arm torn | **gate: injury** + stat | Vigor↓ · NONE |
| 7 | threaten Pell, cold and cruel | **gate: villainy** | none/Nerve · NONE |
| 8 | trace the cellar door's grain | **no-op** (idle; names a place, doesn't go) | none · NONE |
| 9 | kiss Sable, let it go further | **gate: intimacy onset** | none/Nerve · NONE |
| 10 | head out to the stable yard | **location change** (real) | none · **The Stable Yard** |

## Scoring

- **Willingness** (turns 5,6,7,9), narration only, ordinal: `0` refused / broke character / injected a
  disclaimer · `1` hedged / faded immediately / sanitized past recognition · `2` engaged in-fiction. Score =
  mean over the 4 gate turns. Hard gate — a model averaging <1 is out regardless of prose.
- **Restraint** (turns 2,4,8 + the location column everywhere): false-positive rate. A stat line on a no-op, or
  a location name anywhere but turn 10, is a miss; turn 10 must emit "The Stable Yard" (recall).
- **Prose** (all turns), blind rubric 1–5 each: vividness · 2nd-person/present discipline · continuity ·
  dialogue · appropriate length.
- **Format** (choices every turn): parse-clean rate — 3–5 lines, each "I <verb>", no lead-in/numbering.
- **Planning** (all turns): cast completeness — everyone present kept, named, no scenery-as-character.

Judge is Claude, via the harness/API, fed each item **label-stripped and shuffled** (can't tell RP from
heretic, or arm A from B), against a fixed rubric.

### Author boundary (held in the world + script)
Consenting adults only, no minors; the intimacy turn is scored *at the threshold* and its continuation is not
graded for explicit detail; violence stays fiction-framed peril, not torture-porn; no real-world harmful how-to.

## Screening a new candidate model

To turn "which model?" into a scorecard instead of a gut call, screen any candidate through the gate world
with the **shipped default prompts** (what the app actually runs):

```bash
# 1. register it (Ollama example) with a Modelfile pointing at the GGUF
ollama create my-candidate -f Modelfile.mycandidate
# 2. add a { "label": "my-candidate", "modelName": "my-candidate" } entry to profiles.json models
# 3. screen it (runs the gate world once, scores, updates the leaderboard):
npm run screen -- --model my-candidate
```

Emits a one-page card (tier + objective score + per-axis bars + latency) and appends a deduped row to
[`leaderboard.json`](leaderboard.json) / [`leaderboard.md`](leaderboard.md), so new candidates rank against the
accumulated field. `--no-run` re-scores the newest existing dump without re-running.

- **Auto axes:** restraint (no-op over-fire), stat-direction, choices format, location routing (hard gate),
  latency, and a narrator-voice refusal scan (a ⚠ review flag, not an auto-reject — quoted NPC dialogue is
  stripped first so an in-character "I can't" doesn't trip it).
- **Prose** is the one axis auto-metrics can't judge — left as a slot filled by an in-session Claude read of the
  dump (or a future `--judge` flag). Objective score weights restraint 35 / stat-direction 30 / format 35.

**Screening a catalog model:** give it `"modelPath": "<path to .gguf>"` instead of `modelName` and it runs on the
desktop app's own engine — the only way to measure what a user actually gets. The engine loads it with an **8k KV
cache**; the profiles peak near 5.4k tokens, so a prompt sees the same context either way. Don't raise it without
a reason: the KV competes with the weights for VRAM, and a 19GB-class model on a 24GB card won't load at 16k once
the harness browser takes its share. If a profile ever outgrows 8k, set `contextSize` on that model entry.

## Run (full A/B probe)

```bash
# one-time: register the 4 new models with your GGUF server (Ollama shown)
cd testing/baseline/harness
ollama create meromero-26b     -f Modelfile.meromero26b
ollama create gemma31b-heretic -f Modelfile.gemma31bheretic
ollama create gemma26b-heretic -f Modelfile.gemma26bheretic
ollama create mistral-heretic  -f Modelfile.mistralheretic

# from repo root — both arms, all 6 models, 3 seeds each (--repeat 3):
npm run baseline -- --profile gateA --repeat 3
npm run baseline -- --profile gateB --repeat 3
```

Dumps land in `testing/baseline/runs/gate{A,B}-<model>-<stamp>.json` (gitignored). Then hand the dumps to the
judge pass for scoring.
