// OPENING-TIME probe — should the opening-time pass be allowed to say "unstated", or be forced to pick a
// daypart? This is the one open question in the game-start clock design (docs-internal/designs/time-system/design.md):
// everything else about it is settled, and the answer decides the shipped prompt.
//
// The pass runs once at game start, AFTER the opening narration and with <TIME> suppressed, and its answer
// seeds `startHour` on the save envelope. It asks for a DAYPART from the closed set gameClock's `daypart()`
// already emits — never a clock reading — for the same reason the delta pass asks for a duration and not a
// date: a small model picks from six words reliably and cannot do calendar arithmetic.
//
// A 2x2, run together on one set of narrations so neither axis is confounded by the other:
//
//        hatch axis                          gloss axis
//   A  — the set plus `unstated`        (none) — the six words, unexplained
//   B  — the six dayparts only          g      — plus a verbal gloss of where each word falls
//
// The hatch axis is unsettled because the tiers disagree: cloud declined 0 times in 264 (the hatch is inert
// there), while Cydonia declined 27% — and only on scenes with no sky, never on one that states a time.
// The gloss axis targets a measured miss: both tiers read "a few hours past noon" as `midday`, i.e. they
// know the six words but not where gameClock's boundaries actually sit.
//
// Both prompts live HERE, not in GamePrompts.ts, because the arms *are* the candidate prompt and the probe
// is what decides which one ships. Move the winner into GamePrompts.ts as `defaultOpeningTimePrompt`.
//
// Cases split by what they are actually able to measure:
//
//   stated   — authored openings that name a time (../opening-time-cases.json). Real worlds could not
//              supply these: a sweep of every tracked test world found NO time-of-day language in any
//              starting location, only ambient lamps. That absence is why this probe exists, so the stated
//              group is authored the way time-delta-cases.json is, with a ground-truth daypart each.
//              Includes a genuine `morning` case so accuracy cannot be gamed by never answering the value
//              the game already defaults to, and an `afternoon` case a night-leaning model cannot fake.
//   unstated — the REAL test worlds, since that is the true distribution. Nothing here has a right answer.
//
// Metrics:
// EVERY `locationDesc` here is deliberately timeless, and the stated cases put their time in the opening
// ACTION instead. That is not a stylistic choice — it is what makes the location-description arm honest.
// With the time written into the description, a loc arm would simply be handed the answer, and would score
// well for a reason that cannot generalize: the world sweep found no real world that states a time in its
// location text. Putting it in the action matches how the app actually works (the opening cue is editable
// prose sent verbatim to narration only), keeps the descriptions looking like real authored ones, and
// leaves the narration as the sole route by which a time can reach the pass.
//
// Metrics:
//   stated    ACCURACY   answer is in the case's ground-truth set. The headline number for both arms.
//             FALSE-HATCH (arm A only) answered `unstated` on a passage that does state a time. This is the
//                        hatch's real cost and the number that would sink arm A.
//   unstated  HATCH RATE (arm A only) how often it declines.
//             AGREEMENT  per case, the modal answer's share across runs — does it read a stable signal?
//             SPREAD     how many DISTINCT modal dayparts across the unstated cases. This is the decider and
//                        the one that is easy to get wrong: an arm that confidently answers `morning` for
//                        every world scores perfect agreement while being exactly identical to the 08:00
//                        default it was supposed to improve on. Consistency only counts if it varies.
//   INVALID   replies outside the closed set, both arms, as the contract check.
//
// The narration is generated per case from the REAL defaultSystemPrompt, so the probe measures the whole
// chain the feature will use — world text -> opening prose -> the pass -- rather than handing the pass the
// authored description directly. A stated case whose narration silently drops the time is a real failure of
// the design, and this is where it would show up.
//
// Sampler: narration at temp 0.7 (the game's narration pin), the pass at temp 0 (classifier, matching the
// timePassed pin). Cloud is nondeterministic at temp 0, hence the higher run count there.
