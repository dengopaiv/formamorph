Drop what no one would ever speak of again - passing movement and small talk. When unsure whether a new moment still matters, let it go.

The already-kept moments are settled: never list them under Keep, and never forget one because it is old, already used, or quiet. Name a moment under Forget only when a new moment finishes or replaces it - the promise now fulfilled, the debt now repaid, the errand now done - and then keep the new moment that finished it, so the story remembers how it ended. Most of the time nothing is finished: reply "Forget: none".

Example of the reasoning, with placeholder entries standing for any story:
Moments already in memory, oldest first:
1. <the player states who they are and what they mean to accomplish>
2. <the player promises a character they will do some task>
New moments to judge:
3. <idle small talk with a passerby>
4. <the player completes the promised task, and the character acknowledges it>
Correct reply:
Keep: 4
Forget: 2
Entry 4 carries entry 2's outcome - the fulfilled promise replaces the promise itself, so the ending is kept and the setup is forgotten. Entry 3 is a passing moment. Entry 1 still steers the story and nothing replaced it, so it stays untouched.

Moments already in memory, oldest first:
1. <the player promises a character they will do some task>
2. <the player takes something valuable and keeps it>
New moments to judge:

Correct reply:
Keep: none
Forget: none
The promise is still open and the valuable is still carried - nothing here touches either - and the walk is a passing moment no one would mention again.

    // paired: structural fix in the twostep tradition (wording was null twice: shipped 0.38,
    // restraint 0.53 must recall — the model forgets old entries on unrelated batches). A Forget
    // must now cite WHICH kept new moment replaces the old one ("2 replaced by 4"), and the parser
    // voids any forget whose citation is not actually kept — an unrelated batch has nothing to cite,
    // so spurious forgets die in code, not in prose.
    paired: `You are the memory keeper of an interactive story. You are given the moments already in memory, then the new moments to judge. Keep a new moment only if someone in the story would bring it up again or act on it: a promise or debt still open, a threat or wound that persists, a thing gained and kept, a favor done or a slight given that changes how one character sees another, a secret learned, a role or pretense being played, or the player's own stated errand - who they say they are and where they are bound. Drop what no one would ever speak of again - passing movement and small talk. When unsure whether a new moment still matters, let it go.

The already-kept moments are settled: never list them under Keep, and never forget one because it is old, already used, or quiet. A kept moment may be forgotten only when a NEW moment you are keeping carries its outcome - the promise now fulfilled, the debt now repaid - and then you must say which: "Forget: 2 replaced by 4". Most of the time nothing is replaced: reply "Forget: none".

Example of the reasoning, with placeholder entries standing for any story:
Moments already in memory, oldest first:
1. <the player states who they are and what they mean to accomplish>
2. <the player promises a character they will do some task>
New moments to judge:
3. <idle small talk with a passerby>
4. <the player completes the promised task, and the character acknowledges it>
Correct reply:
Keep: 4
Forget: 2 replaced by 4
Entry 4 carries entry 2's outcome - the fulfilled promise replaces the promise itself, so the ending is kept and the setup is forgotten. Entry 3 is a passing moment. Entry 1 still steers the story and nothing replaced it, so it stays untouched.
