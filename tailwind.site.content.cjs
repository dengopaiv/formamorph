/**
 * The files whose classes belong in the account pages' stylesheet.
 *
 * Both directions of getting this wrong are quiet. Scanning all of `src/` puts every class the game
 * uses into a login page's CSS. Scanning too little leaves a reused control unstyled with nothing
 * failing — an avatar's circle simply comes out an oval, because `h-16` was never emitted.
 *
 * It sits apart from `tailwind.site.config.js` so a test can read it: the configs are CommonJS inside
 * an ESM package, which Vitest cannot import, and this one file can be.
 *
 * `site/bundleBoundary.test.ts` walks the site's imports and fails when a file it reaches is in
 * neither list below. The two are kept as plain paths rather than globs so that check is a string
 * comparison — matching globs would mean either a glob library or `fs.globSync`, which does not exist
 * on the Node 20.19 this repo still supports.
