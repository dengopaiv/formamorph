# Thinking Modes — Design Memo

> Internal design note (not wiki-published). Status: **proposal, nothing built.** Grounded in SillyTavern's shipped reasoning mechanics and community thinking-prompt practice — see Sources.

## Why now

MeroMero (a native-reasoning local model) empties `content` and stalls in Formamorph because its native thinking fires uncontrolled. Fixing that surfaced a bigger question: how should Formamorph's four thinking modes relate to how reasoning models are *actually* used in the wild? This memo settles the model layout and specs the near-term Inline hardening.

## The key insight

There are **two independent axes**, and Formamorph currently conflates them:

| Axis | Who drives it | Controllable? |
|---|---|---|
| **Native reasoning** | The *model* decides to think (emits its own `<think>` or a separate `reasoning` field) | Only where the backend allows it — verbose, censorship-prone, model-specific |
| **Guided reasoning** | *We* prompt a short reasoning step in the request | Fully — works on **any** model, bounded by our prompt |

The community consensus (r/SillyTavAI + ST docs): guided/"fake" reasoning is the **robust, universal** path; native reasoning helps **continuity and instruction-adherence at long context, not prose**, and only on a few models (GLM, Kimi). The named pain point is **verbose reasoning dwarfing the output**.

So: guided reasoning is the feature; native reasoning is mostly **interference to suppress** when a guided mode is active.

## Proposed mode layout

A complexity ladder. Native reasoning is an **orthogonal** control, not a fifth mode.

| Mode | What it does | Formamorph-specific? |
|---|---|---|
| **Native** (rename of *Off*) | We add no guidance. If the model reasons natively, we let it; if not, nothing changes. Today's default behavior — just honestly named. | — |
| **Inline** | Appends a `<think>` directive to the **same** narration request; model thinks then writes prose in one completion; block parsed out. This **is** ST's "fake reasoning." | Universal |
| **Planning** | Separate hidden plan call (Scene/Cast/Beats) whose parsed output feeds in-app features (entity parsing) the raw LLM can't reach. | ✅ value-add |
| **Staged** | Planning+: director → character(s) → storyboarder pipeline for features impossible with a single LLM. In infancy. | ✅ value-add |

### The orthogonal control: native-reasoning suppression

- **Native mode** → show the **Reasoning Effort** selector (Auto/Min/…/Max). It's a no-op on non-reasoning models — accept that; ST does the same.
- **Inline / Planning / Staged** (guided modes) → **suppress native reasoning** (`reasoning_effort:none`) so the model's own thinking doesn't fire *on top of* our guided step. This is also the MeroMero "no output" fix.
  - **Open decision:** force-suppress in guided modes, or expose it so a user on GLM/Kimi could deliberately stack native + guided? Recommend **force-suppress by default** with an advanced escape hatch later.

### API capability detection — don't

There's no standard way to detect whether a model reasons. `/v1/models` carries no capability flag; local backends don't advertise it. So **always show Reasoning Effort under Native** and accept it's inert on non-reasoning models. (Matches ST — the setting exists regardless of support.)

## Inline hardening spec

Today's `INLINE_THINKING_DIRECTIVE` is unbounded narrator-continuity guidance. The community prompts converge on a tight structure worth adopting. Common shape across ST's stepped-thinking presets:

1. **Mode-switch signal** — nearly all open with *"Pause your roleplay."*
2. **Short enumerated steps** — a fixed list of *what to consider*, not open-ended.
3. **Hard length cap** — "2–4 points." The direct fix for verbosity.
4. **First-person / in-voice.**
5. **Opener prefill** — several force `Start with: "<think> Okay,"` (the Start-Reply-With trick) to guarantee the tag.
6. **Tag wrap** — `<think></think>` dominant.

**Adaptation for Formamorph:** ST's presets are *character-thought* oriented (NPC feelings/plans); our Inline is *narrator/continuity* oriented. Keep our orientation, borrow the structure. Target directive shape:

> Before the narration, in a `<think></think>` block, plan the turn in **3–4 short bullets**: who is present and what they want, who knows what, positioning/state carried from last turn, and the single beat this turn must land. Keep it terse — no prose. Then write the narration.

Bounding to 3–4 bullets is the whole point: it captures the continuity value ST users prize without the verbose ramble they complain about.

## Reasoning Budget — per-prompt token cap (Slice 4 — SHIPPED + desktop end-to-end confirmed)

A per-prompt cap on **reasoning** length, distinct from the effort level. Proven exact on the desktop engine (node-llama-cpp `budgets.thoughtTokens`): capping thought to 200/100/40/0 tokens landed *exactly* on the cap, narration stayed coherent at every level (even 0), latency scaled 15s→2.2s. `reasoning_effort` levels, by contrast, are binary/noise on `meromero` (Ollama). Interview-locked spec:

| Aspect | Decision |
|---|---|
| **Two controls, not one** | Keep **Reasoning Effort** (Slice 2, `Global\|None\|levels`); add a **separate Reasoning Budget**. They don't merge. |
| **Engine-aware visibility** | On the **desktop local engine** (`localModelActive`) show **Budget**, hide the (inert) Effort; on **external** endpoints show **Effort**, hide the (inert) Budget. Exactly one visible per engine; both stored per-prompt. |
| **Unit** | **% of Max Output Tokens** → `thoughtTokens = round(pct × maxTokens)`. |
| **Default / range** | Default **40%**; slider **0–100%**. `0%` = no reasoning (== None). High % squeezes narration's token share (accepted). |
| **Scope** | narration + choices both get a budget field; it only bites when that prompt actually reasons — narration reasons by default (active), choices defaults to no reasoning (inert until enabled). |
| **Storage** | Per-prompt, in the now-exportable Options/preset data (the fork's domain); travels with preset export/import. |
| **Mechanism** | node-llama-cpp `session.prompt(…, { budgets: { thoughtTokens: N } })`. Also self-hosted llama.cpp-server (`thinking_budget_tokens`). Does **not** reach Ollama/LM Studio/most cloud. |

**Two build-time gaps, both closed:**
1. **Bridge plumbing — done.** `electron/llmEngine.cjs` `promptOptions` maps `body.thinking_budget_tokens → { budgets: { thoughtTokens } }`. The desktop path is a local OpenAI-compat server, so one field mapping was all it needed (no native rewrite).
2. **Slice 1 desktop suppression — done.** The local engine ignores `reasoning_effort`, so `reasoningBudgetBody` returns `thinking_budget_tokens: 0` for guided modes AND uncontrolled prompts — that's how "off" is enforced on the local engine now.

**Shipped shape:** `reasoningBudget?: ReasoningBudgetMap` on `PromptPreset` (percent per kind, preset-scoped, exported); `reasoningBudgetBody`/`resolveReasoningBudgetPct`/`defaultReasoningBudgetPct` in `reasoningEffort.ts` (unit-tested); engine-split control in `PromptOptionsPanel` (`PromptReasoningBudgetField` slider on `localModelActive`, effort tabs otherwise); `makeAIRequest` spreads the budget body on the local engine, effort body on external. Additive preset-share shape change (`FORMAT_VERSION` unchanged). **Desktop end-to-end confirmed** by driving the real `llmEngine.cjs` server standalone (require → `start({modelPath})` → POST `/chat/completions` with `thinking_budget_tokens`): omit/200/40/0 capped the `<think>` block to 1785/873/161/0 chars, narration coherent at every budget. Full path proven minus only the renderer's typechecked field-add.

## `<think>` block UI (Slice 3 — SHIPPED; version 2.1.0, additive save-shape)

Built as three gated increments: (1) pure extraction helpers (`extractReasoning`/`extractReasoningLive`, unit-tested) + the `showReasoning` setting; (2) stream capture (native `reasoning`/`reasoning_content` delta + inline `<think>` + first-token→narration timing) persisted into the per-turn assistant JSON as `reasoning: { text, ms }` on `AITurnResult` (additive save-shape, presence-based, old saves fine); (3) the UI — `ReasoningBlock` above the narration in `MiddlePanel`, fed by `reasoningStreamStore` (external store like `gameplayTextStore`), expanded/"Thinking…" while active → auto-collapse "Thought for Ns", de-emphasized markdown, `showReasoning`-gated (default on). Verified end-to-end: meromero emits `<think>` for a clean inline prompt (node), helpers parse both shapes (unit tests), the app correctly captured *nothing* when the model emitted nothing for its full prompt, and the block renders/collapses/styles correctly (preview via injected store data). **Note:** meromero didn't emit reasoning for the app's *full* narration prompt in Inline mode even though a simple prompt triggered it — that's the pending **Inline directive hardening**, not a block bug. Original spec table retained below.

### Original locked spec

Player-facing collapsible reasoning aside, **below the player action, above that turn's narration** — one block per turn. Interview-locked spec:

| Aspect | Decision |
|---|---|
| **Appears for** | **Native** (a native reasoning model's own thinking, from the `reasoning` stream field or an inline `<think>` in content) + **Inline** (the injected `<think>`). Planning/Staged keep their separate hidden plan in the debug view only. |
| **Live behavior** | Streams live into an **expanded** block while the model reasons, **auto-collapses** the moment narration begins (ChatGPT/Claude pattern). Click to re-expand. |
| **Header** | `Thinking…` + spinner while active → **`Thought for Ns`** once done (wall-clock: reasoning start → narration start). |
| **Rendering** | Full markdown (same pipeline as narration) but in a **de-emphasized container** — muted color, smaller size/line-height, down-scaled headings so a stray `#` doesn't shout. |
| **Setting** | New **"Show reasoning"** toggle (Generation area), **default ON**, collapsed. OFF hides it. |
| **When OFF** | Still **captured & saved**, just hidden — turning it back on reveals it on those turns. |
| **Persistence** | **Saved per-turn** in the save envelope (additive `reasoning` field — likely `{ text, ms }`). Survives reload, shows in scrollback, travels with exported saves. |
| **Empty reasoning** | No block rendered. |
| **Motion** | Expand/collapse respects `prefers-reduced-motion`. |

**Save-shape change → version.** This is an additive save `.json` shape change; the user bumped `package.json` to **2.1.0** (in-development, not released) on 2026-07-09 specifically to carry it. Old saves lack the field and load fine (presence-based). Remind on the actual code change.

**Plumbing to confirm at build:** capture the streaming `reasoning` delta (native) AND the inline `<think>` span in content (`stripReasoning` already isolates the latter); measure `ms` from first reasoning token to first narration token.

## Open decisions

- [x] **Force-suppress native reasoning in guided modes (Slice 1, shipped).** Inline/Planning/Staged send `reasoning_effort:none` on every call (`reasoningEffortBody` returns `none` for any non-`off` mode) so the model's own thinking can't fight the guided step — Planning is outright incompatible with it. Omitted when the endpoint can't accept `none`. Unit-tested.
- [x] **Inline hardening (shipped) — placement was the lever, not wording.** Rewrote `INLINE_THINKING_DIRECTIVE` to the bulleted structure above *and* moved it off the system prompt onto the **final user turn** (like `planDirective`). The probe (`inline-probe.mjs`, 9 cases × 2 runs, `reasoning_effort:none`) isolated the cause: new wording still buried in the system prompt emitted `<think>` on only **Silver-Siren 2/18 · MeroMero 5/18**; the *same* directive on the user turn hit **18/18 on both**, all with narration following, zero bullet-leaks into prose. Recency is what makes small models open the block. Bullet counts run 4–6 (cap is soft; no leaks, so left as-is).
- [x] **`<think>`-block UI (Slice 3) spec locked** — see the section above; next to build under 2.1.0 (save-shape change).
- [x] **Per-prompt reasoning (Slice 2, shipped).** Native mode only. Narration + Choices (`REASONING_CONTROL_KINDS`) get a `Global | None | <levels>` control in their Options tab (narration default Global, choices default None); all other prompts hardwired `none`. `Global` inherits Settings → Generation → Native Reasoning, which now only feeds `Global`-set prompts — it no longer applies to a request on its own. Disabled under the Default preset (via the existing `activePresetIsBuiltIn` lock). Stored in `FORMAMORPH_promptReasoning` (settings, not export shape). Resolved per-requestType in `makeAIRequest` via `resolvePromptReasoning` → `reasoningEffortBody`. Pure logic unit-tested; UI verified (narration=Global, choices=None, bookkeeping prompts show no control, hidden in guided modes).
- [x] **Cloud endpoint tolerates `reasoning_effort`** — probe-verified against `api.lyonade.net`: **rejects the literal `auto` (HTTP 400)** but accepts the real levels (`none`/`minimal`/`low`/`medium`/`high`/`xhigh`/`max` all 200). `auto` isn't a wire value anywhere — every backend 400s on it — so "Default" = omit the field.
- [x] **Endpoint-aware levels (shipped).** Rather than hard-code one set, the app probes each endpoint on connect (`detectSupportedReasoningEfforts`) and shows only accepted levels — remembers each `endpoint|model` in a bounded map (cap 30) so switching endpoints/models reads from cache instead of re-probing, falls back to the universal `none/low/medium/high` when offline/inconclusive. Verified live: cloud → all seven; Ollama → `none/low/medium/high/max` (no `minimal`); LM Studio offline → safe fallback. Native mode wired via `reasoningEffortBody(mode, effort, supported)` (also omits a level the endpoint doesn't accept, so a stale pick can't 400 a turn). All pure logic in `src/lib/reasoningEffort.ts`, unit-tested. Guided modes still send nothing (first open item above).
