// Writes the Saltmarsh Reach fixture world: a torture test for hierarchical placeholders — ownership,
// shared rows, per-row draw weights, and a corner of deliberately broken references. Run with
// `node docs-internal/specs/hierarchical-placeholders/build-fixture.mjs`; import the JSON it writes through the
// library's Import World button.
//
// What is in here on purpose, and what each thing is for:
//
//   Ownership      Molly is a Wildcard of three variants, each *owned* by her, and each owning its own
//                  Hair. Three placeholders read `Hair` in the tree and `Molly › Northern › Hair` away
//                  from it — the naming the flat list used to force into prose.
//   Sharing        One `Eye Color` pool of ten, held by all three variants. The top-level row says
//                  "Used by 3"; each variant's row carries the link icon.
//   Overrides      Northern never rolls two of those ten and Fen-Born never rolls a third, each set on
//                  its own row, none of it touching the original. Harl drunk never murmurs.
//   Nested         `Lean Build` is a shared Object held by two variants. Its panel shows no weight
//                  column (an Object never draws), and Northern still benches a Height one level under
//                  it — an override on a row inside a shared row.
//   Broken corner  Every Test Bench placeholder rule has something here to find, the three ownership
//                  and sharing rules included. Nothing outside that corner should raise anything.
