# 04: Server: refuse bundled worlds

Status: ready-for-human
Base: b20e282 (FormamorphServer)
Blocked by: 01
Recommended model: Claude Opus 5.5 (`claude-opus-5-5`)
Reasoning effort: high

Rationale: a second implementation of the fingerprint that must agree exactly with the client's, plus route wiring on publish and update.

Workplace: the FormamorphServer repo. Its spec is `docs-internal/specs/bundled-upload-block/spec.md` there.

## What to build

An old client, or a player with a duplicated bundled world, publishes it. The server refuses with a 400 and the message "This is a bundled world. Edit it to make it your own, then publish." Nothing is stored. An update that replaces a listing's content with a bundled world is refused the same way. A world with real text edits is accepted.

## Inputs from ticket 01

- The list is the client's `bundledFingerprints.json`, shaped `{"worlds": [hex], "avatars": [hex]}`. Both arrays hold sorted lowercase SHA-256 hex strings. Keep that file name on the server: the release step finds the server copy by that name, and it skips the copy until the file exists there. Ticket 04 makes the first copy by hand.
- The shared vector is the client's `bundled-fingerprint-vector.json`, shaped `{"world": {...}, "fingerprint": "<hex>"}`. It pins these rules: normalize whitespace, then measure; length in UTF-16 code units; skip the `code` subtree; remove duplicates; sort by code unit. Plain JS `.length` and the default `.sort()` match these rules.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] The server fingerprint function returns the shared test vector's expected value from ticket 01.
- [ ] The fingerprint list file from ticket 01 is copied in, and loaded once at startup into a set.
- [ ] The publish route refuses a world kind listing whose fingerprint is in the set, before storing anything.
- [ ] The update route applies the same check to new content.
- [ ] Route tests use a test list built from a small fixture world: refused on match, accepted after one long text value changes, ordinary worlds accepted.
- [ ] Each guard is proven to bite. Server test suite green.
