# 02: Pin on Submit, Streaming, and Jump to Latest

Status: ready-for-human
Base: 6f7bd1ec
Blocked by: 01
Recommended model: Claude Opus 5 (`claude-opus-5`)
Reasoning effort: high

Spec: `docs-internal/specs/chat-layout/spec.md`

## What to build

In Chat, a submit puts the player's action bubble at the top of the viewport. The narration streams into a
bubble below it, with the same reveal as Pages. The view does not move again by itself. When the newest text
is off screen, a **Jump to Latest** button shows and returns the player to it.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] On submit, the new turn's top scrolls to the viewport top. The scroll is smooth, and instant under reduced motion. The pin scrolls the element directly, not through the virtualizer's index scroll.
- [x] The submitted turn gets a minimum height of one viewport and keeps it until the next submit.
- [x] The scroll offset stays constant from the pin to the end of a stream that goes past the fold. The reveal continues below the fold.
- [x] The live reasoning block shows inside the latest narration bubble, above the text.
- [x] After a player scroll the view stays manual. Scrolls that the code starts do not count as player scrolls.
- [x] Jump target and Jump button visibility are pure functions per the spec's geometry rules, with unit tests for a short turn, a long turn, the clamp, and the three visibility cases.
- [x] The button reads "Jump to Latest", and says that new text is below while a reply streams. Copy per the player-facing voice rules.
- [x] Playwright covers: action top at the viewport top after submit; constant scroll offset through the stream; the button shows, works, and hides; the smooth pin has more than one frame with movement. Motion is never asserted in seconds.
- [x] Each new guard is proven once by reinstating the bug it guards. Four gates green, and the e2e run time is stated.

## Comments

- **Minimum height uses a container unit.** The scroller is a size container and the pinned turn takes
  `min-height: 100cqh`. A height held in React state lags the scroller by one frame: when the progress bar
  leaves at the end of a reply, the browser clamped the pinned offset by 28px. The e2e reduced-motion case
  caught it.
- **The live turn has no scroll anchor.** The latest turn carries `overflow-anchor: none` while a reply
  streams. Without it, the browser anchored on a node inside the growing turn and moved the view 78px.
- **Player scroll = player input.** Wheel, touch, a key press, or a press on the scrollbar ends any code
  scroll and any re-aim. Scroll events alone never count, so code scrolls need no timer flag.
- **For ticket 03:** `useChatPin` returns `isProgrammaticScroll()`. It is true from a pin or jump start
  until that scroll lands, stalls, or the player takes over.
- **Not changed:** 01's open-at-bottom re-aim still runs its frames after a player scroll. Ticket 03 owns
  that effect.
- **Player input stops a code glide.** A wheel during a smooth jump did not always cancel the browser's
  smooth scroll, so the jump overrode the player. Player input now writes the current offset instantly, but
  only while a code scroll is in flight. That guard is probabilistic: without the fix it failed 1 of 8 to 8 of
  8 per batch, and with it 0 of 18.
- **Reduced motion counts glide frames.** On mobile the action input shrinks on submit. The viewport grows
  and the browser clamps the offset one frame before the pin. The test counts offsets between the start and
  the landing, so a resize clamp does not count as a glide.
- "New Text Below" shows only while the latest text ends below the viewport.
- Jump to Latest also follows reduced motion. The e2e suite (`e2e/chat-pin.spec.ts`, 14 cases) ran on the
  combined tree with tickets 03-05 in about 130 s wall.
- Gates at the review follow-up: typecheck, lint, test (662 files), and build all green.
