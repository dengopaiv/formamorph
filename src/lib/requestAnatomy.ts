 * prompt-editor surface the player can type in, and *context*, which the app assembled around it. The runs
 * ride as a sidecar: a parallel structure aligned to the messages by index and offset, never a field on
 * {@link ChatMessage}. Nothing here can reach an endpoint, because nothing here is a message.
 *
 * A source names the *editor*, not the prompt: every pass has a System Prompt and most have a User Message,
 * so which prompt a run belongs to comes from the request's own type (see `promptJump`).
 *
 * Runs are built by joining labeled pieces ({@link tilePieces}), so a message's runs tile its content by
 * construction — the offsets cannot drift from the text they index.
