 * renders, in their rendered form (a chip set to `summary` is scanned as its summary, because that is what
 * the model was told).
 *
 * The one exception is always-present scaffolding — the world description, the authored prompt body, the
 * generated guidance blocks, and the stat/trait rosters. Their text repeats every turn, so keywords on them
 * would fire permanently: noise rather than signal. Lore triggering other lore stays opt-in per entry
 * (`recursive`), so a cascade is always the author's explicit choice.
