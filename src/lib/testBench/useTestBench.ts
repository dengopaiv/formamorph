/**
 * The whole Test Bench orchestration behind the World Editor: open/close, the per-world Instrument tab, the
 * debounced rule pass and the on-demand stat-code check, the lens, the trigger report, the two view-models,
 * seen-state, and quick-fix write-through. The editor keeps only wiring — where its own selection stands and
 * how to land on an item — so the view stops changing for Bench reasons.
 *
 * Reads and writes the authored world through GameDataContext directly; the panel itself stays presentational
 * and receives everything as `panelProps`.
