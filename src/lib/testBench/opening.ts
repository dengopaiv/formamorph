/**
 * The Opening instrument's data: what a fresh game as the lens PC actually looks like — every stat settled
 * at its real turn-one value, the traits and pins in force, the wildcard rolls with their true odds, and the
 * first prompt exactly as the model receives it.
 *
 * Everything is computed by the game's own machinery: stats settle through `traitRuntime` (the same seeding,
 * clamping and bound derivation a new game runs), chips resolve through `resolvePlaceholders` with the
 * active traits' pins, and the first prompt is `buildNarrationPrompt` over `authoredPreviewValues` — the
 * assembly a real opening turn performs. A second implementation of any of these could disagree with play,
 * which would make the instrument a liar.
 *
 * Prompts and generation settings are global settings the editor cannot read, so the shipped defaults stand
 * in for them — the AI Context instrument's precedent.
 *
 * Pure and world-shaped: no React, no storage, no world mutation.
