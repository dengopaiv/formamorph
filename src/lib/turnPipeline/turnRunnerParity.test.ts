 * later pass renders against is the run's own — and the request sequence the pipeline emits must be the
 * sequence the run dispatched.
 *
 * What is compared: for every request, in order, its type, its token cap, and its silent/attached-turn
 * envelope; plus byte-exact messages for the passes whose every input the fixture holds. What is not: the
 * context values a system prompt renders against were never recorded, so system prompts are compared by
 * template in turnPlanParity.test.ts instead.
