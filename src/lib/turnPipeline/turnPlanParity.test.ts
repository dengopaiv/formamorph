/**
 * Parity: the Turn Plan against the run recorded from the code it replaces
 * (testing/parity/turn-pipeline-parity.json, captured before any extraction began). Replaying the
 * recorded actions through the planner must produce the same passes, in the same order, with the same
 * caps and the same messages.
 *
 * What is compared, and what is not:
 * - **Pass sequence** — exact, with fan-out passes (one request per cast member / diarist) collapsed,
 *   since how many the director named is a model answer, not a planner decision.
 * - **Messages** — byte-exact for every pass whose user message is built from the action, the narration
 *   and the recorded plan: the router, the director, the narration, choices, stats, the digest and both
 *   clock passes. Three are excluded — the character and diary passes carry world entity blurbs and a
 *   character's accumulated diary, and the storyboard carries the per-character intents, none of which
 *   the fixture records separately.
 * - **System prompts** — asserted to be renders of the same template (its literal text, in order). The
 *   context values a template renders against are not in the fixture, so byte parity of a system prompt
 *   arrives with the runner, which is handed the real context.
 * - Drainer requests (milestone selection) are not turn passes and are excluded; see the fixture README.
