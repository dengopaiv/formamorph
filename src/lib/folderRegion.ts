 * The region of a folder's board that its tile shows: the top-left corner, as many columns wide as the

 *
 * The face and the camera both read this, so the picture the player clicks and the picture the zoom
 * lands on cannot drift apart.
 *
 * The cap is two medium columns per base cell of the tile. It is never narrower than the member in the
 * board's corner, so a large member on a small folder tile leaves the face something to draw. That
 * member is the one the region is built around, so it is never left out — the tile's own shape crops a
 * few percent off its bottom where their spans differ, which is the closest a single scale can come.
 *
 * @param members - The members the open folder draws, in its reading order
 * @param places - The open folder board's homes for those members, at `baseCols`
 * @param tileSpan - The folder tile's own span on the library board
 * @param baseCols - Base-cell columns of the board itself, which the region never exceeds
