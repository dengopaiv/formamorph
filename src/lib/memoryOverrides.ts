 * The player's memory override layer: rewrites, deletions and hand-written memories, applied on top of
 * the AI's digests. Design: docs-internal/designs/memory-editing/design.md.
 *
 * The AI's original is never destroyed — `summary` on the turn stays exactly as the digest wrote it and
 * every override lives in its own map, keyed by turn id like `memoryPins`. Clearing an override restores
 * the original text and its stored verdict, so every change is reversible from the save alone.
 *
 * Applied at the one chokepoint (`parseTurns` → `applyMemoryOverrides`) so every consumer — narration
 * recap, planner recap, selector input, semantic retrieval, the panel — reads the same effective text and
 * the model can never see a pre-edit version.
