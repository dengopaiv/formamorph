/**
 * Semantic rehydration selection: which old turns come back verbatim because the current action
 * returns to them. Selection is embedding-based (the turn's digest vector stands for the turn) with
 * the two guards that define this feature (docs-internal/notes/semantic-memory-roadmap/notes.md step 2):
 *   1. Near-duplicate penalty — a candidate too similar to an already-chosen turn OR to a recent
 *      floor turn is skipped. Raw similarity maximally favors the repeated charged turns that caused
 *      the charged-scene freeze; the penalty is what makes similarity safe to use here.
 *   2. Temporal framing is the caller's half: chosen turns ride as an explicit remembered-scene
 *      exchange (turnBanding), never as live-looking history.
 * Pure module; embedding production lives with the caller.
