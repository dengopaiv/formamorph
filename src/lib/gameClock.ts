/**
 * In-world clock formatting: turns elapsed story hours into the labels the AI reads.
 *
 * Memory is accurate about what happened and silent about when — digests ride as an undated chronicle,
 * so the model cannot tell an hour ago from three weeks ago and invents. This module renders a memory's
 * position in story time both ways, absolute ("Day 3, evening") and relative ("two days ago"), because
 * models are unreliable at deriving either from the other.
 *
 * Pure and React-free. The clock's *source* is deliberately not here: callers hand in a `hoursAt`
 * resolver, so the flat hour-per-turn the game advances today and a measured per-turn delta later are
 * the same seam. Design: docs-internal/designs/time-system/design.md.
