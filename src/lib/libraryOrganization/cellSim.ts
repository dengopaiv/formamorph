 * The mixed-size tile drag, as an ungrouped board of base cells.
 *
 * Through the whole gesture the board simulates what single cells would do: every cell the dragged
 * footprint sweeps over hops directly behind its trailing edge, which is exactly the dodge a flat grid
 * of one-cell tiles performs. Backtracking runs the same steps the other way, so retreating walks the
 * cells home.
 *
 * A group of cells is still one tile, so it moves only once the gesture has swept at least half of its
 * cells — accumulated over the path, not read off one moment. It then relocates by the way its cells
 * leaned, shape intact, and only to a spot that is on the board and free. A tile that never consents
 * never moves, so clipping a large tile's corner cannot teleport it.
 *
 * Pure: no DOM, no clock, no storage. One instance per gesture, because the accumulated sweep is the
 * gesture's own history.
 *
 * @param tiles - Every tile's home when the gesture started, the dragged one included
 * @param draggedId - The tile the player is carrying; it is pinned rather than simulated
 * @param columns - Base-cell columns the board is wide
 * @param consent - Fraction of a tile's cells the sweep must cover before the tile moves
