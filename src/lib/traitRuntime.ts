// Trait runtime orchestration: acquiring a trait mid-play, switching one on or off, and the stat maths that
// goes with it. Pure over a small slice of gameplay state, so all of it is reachable from a test.
//
// Two rules shape everything here:
//
// - Bounds are DERIVED, never patched. A stat's effective min/max/regen is its authored base plus the
//   contributions of whichever traits are active right now plus what the AI has moved. Recomputing instead
//   of accumulating means bounds cannot drift however many times a trait is toggled.
// - Value movement is RECORDED. A trait's stat change that a floor or ceiling refused moved nothing, so
//   switching it off must give back nothing. Each switch stores what actually moved and the next switch of
//   that trait reverses it, rather than the authored number.
