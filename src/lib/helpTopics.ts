**What you can do to a memory**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Edit** | Rewrite it in your own words. An edited memory is always kept — you wrote it, so the story doesn't get to drop it. |
| **Rewrite** | Have the story summarize that turn again, in case the first attempt missed the point. |
| **Pin / forget** | Force a memory to stay, or let one go, without changing its words. |
| **Delete** | Remove it entirely. Nothing is really lost — switch the filter to **Deleted** to bring it back. |
| **Add Memory** | Write something the story should remember that never happened in a turn. Yours are always kept. |

**Nothing you do here is permanent.** The story's own version is always kept underneath, so **Revert** restores the original wording and **Reset All My Changes** puts everything back the way the story had it.

Memories under the **Recent** line are still fresh enough that the story has them word-for-word — your changes to them start mattering once they age out.

**Kept isn't the same as sent.** A memory the story keeps still has to earn its place each turn — with **Semantic Memory** on, only the handful most relevant to what you just did actually rides. Rows with a **left accent bar** reached the story last turn; plain rows are remembered but sat this one out; struck-through rows are the ones it let go. A memory sent back as a full scene is marked **Scene**. The filter chips sort by the form the story has a memory in: **Verbatim** (its real text — a recent turn, or one recalled as a scene), **Summary** (the compressed line, sent last turn), **Held** (remembered, but not sent this turn).

**When it happened.** With **Measured Clock** on, each memory carries its place in the story's time — *"Day 3, evening — two days ago"* — the same stamp the story itself reads.

Those are remembered from the moment they're named, so the story can keep them consistent and offer you things to do with them.

Someone merely *talked about* isn't added — only characters the story actually shows in the scene.

**When something isn't a person**

Names come out of the story's own prose, so once in a while it capitalizes a café or a street and that ends up here. Use the remove button beside the entry to take it out. The story stops picking that name up for the rest of this playthrough, and the prose itself is left exactly as written.

Locations exist to keep the story somewhere. Without a fixed place the narrator drifts: the tavern becomes a street becomes a forest, and nothing stays put. A location is an anchor the AI is handed again every turn.

**Nesting is the AI's map, not the player's.** The player can travel anywhere at any time — the in-game location list offers every location in your world, unfiltered.

What nesting decides is where *the story* can take them. When the AI reads an action as movement, it only considers places connected to where they are: down into a sub-location, or up and sideways from one. It then offers the move — *Move to the Eelhouse?* — and the player takes it or dismisses it. Nest your places and the story starts proposing journeys through them. Leave them flat and travel stays something the player reaches for.

**What the AI sees**

- **AI-Facing Description** — the full text the AI works from. The player never sees it, so it's where a secret belongs.
- **AI-Facing Summary** — a one-line version for slots where the full text is too long; the default prompt uses it for sub-locations and reachable places. Left blank, the full description is used instead.
- **Player-Facing Description** — what the player reads in the location panel. Never sent to the AI, so whatever you write here, the player simply knows.
- **Entities** — who's here. The same list an entity's own Locations picker writes to, from the other end.

**Starting location** marks where a new game can begin, and the box does more than it looks:

- **Tick none** and the game starts somewhere random — *any* location in the world.
- **Tick one** and every game starts there.
- **Tick several** and the player chooses between them before starting.

The background image, image tags and ambient sound are for the player's screen — the narrator never sees them.

**Simple mode hides** AI-Facing Summary, Ambient Sound and Image Tags. Switch the editor to Advanced to use them.

They exist to give the AI a cast it can't lose track of. Left to itself the narrator invents a stranger, gives them a name, and forgets both by the next turn. An entity is a fixed, reusable character the story can keep returning to.

**What the AI sees.** An entity only reaches the AI when the player is somewhere it's assigned to — that assignment is the whole gate.

- **Name** — always sent.
- **AI-Facing Description** — the full description, and the main thing the AI knows. **The player never sees this field**, so it's where a secret belongs: who the ferryman really works for, what's behind the door. The default prompt does ask the narrator to hold a name back until the player would have learned it — but that's a request to the AI, not a guarantee.
- **AI-Facing Summary** — a one-line version for prompt slots where the full text is too long; the default prompt uses it for entities in reachable locations. Left blank, the full description is used instead.
- **Player-Facing Description** — what the player reads when they look at this entity. **Never sent to the AI**, so it costs no context — and anything you write here, the player simply knows.

**Locations** decides where the entity can appear. Assign it to as many as you like; an entity in no location never reaches the AI at all.

**The link lives on the location.** Assigning locations here just writes the entity into each of those locations' lists — so **deleting a location quietly drops its entities from it**. They aren't deleted, but one that was only in that location now appears nowhere, and nothing warns you.

Given only the name, the narrator writes "the Warden" and Formamorph no longer sees Rosalind in the scene — she drops off the cast, out of the choices, off the Entities tab. An alias closes that gap, and the AI is told the nickname too so it can reach for it naturally.

**What an alias does**

- **Detection.** When an alias appears in the narration, the entity counts as present that turn — exactly as if its name had appeared. This drives who shows in the Entities tab, who the choices consider, and which characters travel with the scene.
- **Told to the AI.** Aliases are sent alongside the name as *also known as*, so the narrator knows Rosalind and the Warden are one person and can use either.

**How matching works**

- **Case-sensitive**, unlike the name. Write an alias with the capitalization it'll appear in — *Cat* matches *Cat*, not *cat*. This is deliberate: short nicknames would otherwise fire inside ordinary words (*Cat* inside *category*, *scatter*).
- **Whole words only**, and **plurals match** — an alias *Wolf* is found in *Wolves*.
- **Skip a leading "the"/"a".** Write *Gray One*, not *the Gray One*. An article baked into the alias, matched case-sensitively, would miss *The Gray One* at the start of a sentence.

Aliases apply in every mode, and they travel with the world and with an exported character card.

Give a character the one or two names the story will actually use. Each alias is also a line the AI reads whenever the entity is in scene, so a long list is just extra prompt for no gain.`,

A value that is a chip pins that part — pin a Wildcard to the value holding *isAsian* and every chip of it takes that variant. The box names such a value after the part it holds, exactly as the Values list does, so you pick by the thing rather than by the words it joins to.

Rows sit in the order the game settles them: a stat band outranks a location, a location a trait, and a trait a placeholder value. Within one kind the lower in its own list wins, and each row says who else claims the placeholder and which one the rules pick.

They exist so a world can vary without being rewritten. Author *"the {{Eye Color}} stranger"* once, and it reads as a real detail every playthrough — sometimes the same detail on purpose, sometimes a fresh one each time.

**The Kind row says what a placeholder is:**

- **Wildcard** — it randomizes. One of its values is picked, and every chip of it shows that pick. Good for variety — a crowd of strangers who aren't all identical.
- **Object** — it holds. All of its values apply, joined together wherever it is placed. Good for a thing made of parts.
- **Variable** — what either kind is called while it has one value. It always resolves to that value, so changing it here updates every chip.

New placeholders are born Wildcards, and one you have never touched reads as the kind its value count already implies.

**Parts.** A value that is exactly one chip is a **part** of the placeholder holding it, addressable as \`Name › Part\`. That is how an Object is built out of other placeholders.

**World vs. Unique** (Wildcards only). Each chip you place chooses how its roll is shared:

- **World** — every World chip of this placeholder rolls once and shows the *same* value everywhere. One randomly-chosen town name, used consistently across the whole world.
- **Unique** — each placement rolls on its own. Ten Unique chips of *Eye Color* give ten independent eyes.

**The roll is frozen for the playthrough.** A Wildcard is rolled once, when a game begins, and stored in that save. The stranger who had gray eyes on turn one still has them on turn ninety — reload the save and nothing shifts. A new game rolls fresh.

**Where chips work.** Anywhere with the chip picker: entity, location and dictionary descriptions, the readme, the system prompt addition. They resolve both in what the AI reads and in what the player sees. The **World Description is the exception** — it's read in the library before any game exists, so there are no rolls yet, and it takes no chips.

**Placeholders are Advanced-only** — the editor's mode switch has to be on Advanced for this tab and the chip palette to appear.

They exist to give the story a memory with consequences. Prose alone drifts; a stat is a fact the AI has to write around — a low one shows up as effort and cost, a high one as ease. The narrator is told to work them into events rather than announce them, so stats shape the story without reading like a spreadsheet.

**What the AI sees.** Each stat's **Name** is always sent. The Stats chip in your prompt picks what rides along with it:

- **Values** — the current number and its ceiling, like \`62/100\` (or \`62%\` for a percentage stat).
- **Status** — the matching **Stat Descriptor**, a word for the current level.
- **Meaning** — the stat's **Description**, i.e. what it represents.

**The fields**

- **Type** — a **Number** stat spans a range you set; a **Percentage** stat is pinned from 0 to 100 and shown everywhere as \`N%\`. Everything below works the same for both — a percentage stat just fixes the range for you and drops the Max, so you only set its **Initial Value (%)**.
- **Min / Max / Initial Value** set the range and where the stat starts. (A percentage stat locks Min/Max at 0/100 and shows just Initial Value.)
- **Regen** is added every turn, then clamped to the range — a positive number heals over time, a negative one bleeds.
- **Stat Descriptors** turn a number into a word. A threshold is a **value of this stat** — on a 0–10 stat, \`3\` means 3 — and it is the *top* of its band, so the lowest band the value fits in wins, whatever order you list them in. Give the highest one a threshold of your **Max**, or a value above it gets no descriptor at all. The coverage bar draws every band's real extent with the gap above them in red, and each row says what it covers. Switch **Thresholds in** to **% of Max** if you would rather the bands rescale when you change the range; your numbers are converted as you switch, so nothing moves.
- **Prevent AI Changes** locks a stat against the AI in one direction. Useful for anything only your world's rules should move.

**Test Code** runs your script right there and shows the number it produced, as a one-hour turn on day one. It's the ground truth — the underlines in the editor are advice given without running anything.

**What your script can reach.** A read-only copy of every stat and nothing else: no page, no network, no other stat's code. Each one carries \`id\`, \`name\`, \`type\`, \`description\`, \`min\`, \`max\`, \`value\` and \`regen\`. \`stats\` is the list; \`currentStatId\` is the id of the stat you're editing.

| \`elapsedHours\` | Total story hours so far, counting this turn |
| \`day\` | Day number at the **end** of the turn |
| \`daypart\` | Time of day at the **end** of the turn |
| \`startDay\` | Day number at the **start** of the turn |
| \`startDaypart\` | Time of day at the **start** of the turn |

Both ends are given because a turn spans time: an eight-hour sleep begins in the afternoon and ends at night. Dayparts are \`night\`, \`dawn\`, \`morning\`, \`midday\`, \`afternoon\`, \`evening\`. With **Measured Clock** off, \`deltaHours\` is simply \`1\`.

That's what makes a per-hour drain (\`current + 2 * deltaHours\`) or a stat that only climbs after dark possible. One catch: a script mentioning any of these re-runs **every** turn, since time passes every turn — a script that mentions none of them runs only when a stat changes.

**A calculated stat ignores the AI.** Whatever the AI writes gets recomputed away, though it still *reads* the value and description normally.

- **earlier turns**, both your actions and the AI's replies, as far back as the entry's **Scan depth** allows — all of them by default, none at 0.

Text that's present every single turn is deliberately left out — your world description, stats, traits, and formatting guidance — since its terms would otherwise fire constantly.

**The controls**

- **Keywords** fire an entry — list as many as you like, comma-separated, and any single match is enough.
- **Always inject** skips the scan and sends the entry every turn — use sparingly, it costs context every turn.
- **Secondary Keywords** add a condition: *bridge* fires only if *toll* also appears in the scanned text.
- **Background** and **Foreground** are two separate lore blocks placed in the system prompt; drag an entry between a book's two groups to move it. By default, Background comes earlier than Foreground.
- **Recursive** entries can also be fired by the content of entries that already activated, not just by the scene.
- **Books** group related entries: their order sets injection order, and disabling one mutes everything in it. Players may override those toggles before starting.

**Simple mode hides** Always inject, Regex, Recursive, Scan depth and Secondary Keywords, along with the Background/Foreground split and the enable toggles. Switch the editor to Advanced to use them.

Start with one book and a few entries. Reach for the extra controls only when an entry fires when it shouldn't.`,
