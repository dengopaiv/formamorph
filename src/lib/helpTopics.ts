| **Edit This Memory** | Rewrite it in your own words. An edited memory is always kept. You wrote it, so the story can't drop it. |
| **Have the Story Write This Memory Again** | The story summarizes that turn again, in case the first attempt missed the point. |
| **Pin This Memory** / **Forget This Memory** | Force a memory to stay, or let one go, without changing its words. **Clear Pin (Let the Story Decide)** gives the decision back to the story. |
| **Delete This Memory** | Remove it entirely. Nothing is really lost. Select the **Deleted** chip, then **Restore This Memory**. |
| **Add Memory** | Write something the story should remember that never happened in a turn. Yours are always kept. |

**Nothing you do here is permanent.** The story's own version is always kept underneath, so **Revert to the Original** restores the original wording and **Reset All My Changes** puts everything back the way the story had it.

Memories under the **Recent** line are still fresh enough that the story has them word-for-word — your changes to them start mattering once they age out.

**Kept isn't the same as sent.** A memory the story keeps still has to earn its place each turn — with **Semantic Memory** on, only the handful most relevant to what you just did actually rides. Rows with a **left accent bar** reached the story last turn; plain rows are remembered but sat this one out; struck-through rows are the ones it let go. A memory sent back as a full scene is marked **Scene**. The filter chips sort by the form the story has a memory in: **Verbatim** (its real text — a recent turn, or one recalled as a scene), **Summary** (the compressed line, sent last turn), **Held** (remembered, but not sent this turn).

**When it happened.** With **Measured Clock** on, each memory carries its place in the story's time — *"Day 3, evening — two days ago"* — the same stamp the story itself reads. Without that setting every turn costs a flat hour whatever happened in it, so nothing is dated rather than dating it wrongly. **Measured Clock** is in **Settings** → **Output** → **Time**, in **Advanced** mode.`,

Those are remembered from the moment they're named, so the story can keep them consistent and offer you things to do with them.

Someone only *talked about* isn't added. The story has to show them in the scene. Someone who introduces themselves ("I'm Freya") counts as shown.

Locations keep the story in one place. Without a fixed place the narrator loses track of where the scene is. The tavern becomes a street, then a forest, and nothing stays put. A location is sent to the AI again every turn, so the scene stays where you put it.

**Nesting is the AI's map, not the player's.** The player can travel anywhere at any time. The in-game location list offers every location in your world, unfiltered.

Nesting decides where *the story* can take them. When the AI reads an action as movement, it only considers places connected to where they are: down into a sub-location, or up and sideways from one. It then offers the move, *Move to the Eelhouse?*, and the player takes it or dismisses it. Nest your places and the story starts proposing journeys through them. Leave them flat and travel only happens when the player asks for it.

**Making one.** A new location starts at the top level. Nesting it is a second move.

- **List.** Drag a row by its grip. Up and down change the order. Sideways changes the level.
- **Keyboard.** Focus a grip and press Space to pick up the row. Up and Down move it through the list. Left and Right move it out of or into the row above. Press Space to drop it, or Escape to cancel.
- **Canvas.** Drag a box onto a box that has sub-locations. To nest into a box with none, hold the drag still until the box is highlighted, then release.

Deleting a parent does not delete its children. They move up one level.

**What the AI sees**

- The **AI-Facing Description** field is the full text the AI works from. The player never sees it, so it's where a secret belongs.
- The **AI-Facing Summary** field is a one-line version for slots where the full text is too long. The default prompt uses it for sub-locations and reachable places. Left blank, the full description is used instead.
- The **Player-Facing Description** field is what the player reads in the location panel. It's never sent to the AI, so whatever you write here, the player knows.
- The **Entities** list is who's here. It's the same list an entity's own Locations picker writes to, from the other end.

**Starting Location** marks where a new game can begin, and the checkbox does more than it looks:

- Tick none and the game starts at random, in *any* location in the world

**What the AI sees.** An entity only reaches the AI when the player is somewhere it's assigned to. That assignment is the only condition.

- The **Name** field is always sent
- The **AI-Facing Description** field is the full description, and the main thing the AI knows. **The player never sees this field**, so it's where a secret belongs: who the ferryman really works for, what's behind the door. The default prompt does ask the narrator to hold a name back until the player would have learned it, but that's a request to the AI, not a guarantee.
- The **AI-Facing Summary** field is a one-line version for prompt slots where the full text is too long. The default prompt uses it for entities in reachable locations. Left blank, the full description is used instead.
- The **Player-Facing Description** field is what the player reads when they look at this entity. It's **never sent to the AI**, so it costs no context, and anything you write here, the player knows.
- The **Pronouns** field is sent beside the name, so the AI refers to the entity the right way
- The **Type** field is sent as a plain field
- The entity's active traits are sent after its description

The **Locations** picker decides where the entity can appear. Assign it to as many as you like. An entity in no location never reaches the AI at all.

**The entity holds its own locations.** A location's **Entities** picker shows the same link from the other side. **Deleting a location drops it from its entities.** They aren't deleted, but one that was only in that location now appears nowhere, and nothing warns you.

The **Persona** control decides whether the player can play as this entity: **Cast**, **Playable**, **Persona-Only** or **Custom Persona**.

The **Traits** tab holds the entity's own traits. The **Openings** tab holds openings that start the game in this entity's voice.

Aliases keep the story recognizing an entity even when it doesn't use the full name. Given only the name, the narrator writes "the Warden" and Rosalind is no longer detected in the scene. She drops off the cast, out of the choices, off the Entities tab. An alias closes that gap, and the AI is told the nickname too so it can use it naturally.

**What an alias does**

- **Detection.** When an alias appears in the narration, the entity counts as present that turn, exactly as if its name had appeared. This decides who shows in the Entities tab, who the choices consider, and which entities travel with the scene.
- **Told to the AI.** Aliases are sent alongside the name as *also known as*, so the narrator knows Rosalind and the Warden are one person and can use either

**How matching works**

- **Case-sensitive**, unlike the name. Write an alias with the capitalization it'll appear in. *Cat* matches *Cat*, not *cat*. This is deliberate: short nicknames would otherwise fire inside ordinary words (*Cat* inside *category*, *scatter*).
- **Whole words only**, and **plurals match**. An alias *Wolf* is found in *Wolves*.
- **Skip a leading "the"/"a".** Write *Gray One*, not *the Gray One*. An article inside the alias, matched case-sensitively, would miss *The Gray One* at the start of a sentence.

Aliases apply in every mode, and they travel with the world and with an exported character card.

Give an entity the one or two names the story will actually use. Each alias is also a line the AI reads whenever the entity is in scene, so a long list is extra prompt for no gain.`,

**Only chosen traits count.** A trait the player didn't take isn't sent to the AI and changes nothing. Everything below applies to the ones they picked.

**What the AI sees**

- The **AI-Facing Description** field is what the AI is told this trait means. Leave it blank and the AI gets only the trait's name, which is often enough for something like *Left-Handed*.

- **Mode** sets who controls the trait. **Optional** lets the player choose it. **Always On** turns it on whenever its requirements hold, and the player can't switch it. **Hidden** works like **Always On**, and the player never sees it.
- **Enabled by Default** pre-checks an Optional trait on the selection screen. The player can still uncheck it.
- **Player Can Toggle In-Game** lets the player turn an Optional trait on or off during play.

**Stat Changes** adjust a stat when the trait is taken. The section's own **?** explains each property and how the numbers stack.

**Groups** organize the list, and they also speak to the AI: give a group an AI-Facing Description and it becomes a header above its chosen traits, so you can frame a whole set at once (*"Origin: where this life began"*). A group with nothing chosen inside it is skipped entirely.

**Pick Count** on a group sets how many of its traits the player must and can pick: **Any**, **Exactly One**, **Up to One**, or **Custom** with **At Least** and **At Most**. **Start game** waits until every group has its minimum.

**Entities can have traits.** Each entity with traits shows as a node below the world's traits. Its active traits describe it to the AI, and they become the player's when the player plays that entity. Type \`{{char}}\` in a trait's text to name whoever has it.

**Links share one trait.** Drag a Blueprints trait or group onto an entity node, or select it and use **Link To…** in the footer. The entity gets that trait, its **original**, without a copy. Drag a top-level trait onto an entity node, and it moves to that entity instead. A link reads the original live until you change a field on it. Each field you change is an override for that link only: Mode, Enabled by Default, Requires, Placeholder Pins, Player Can Toggle In-Game and Stat Changes.

- **Reset** returns one field to the original. **Reset to Blueprint** returns them all.

**Blueprints** holds originals that only some entities get, like classes and races. Add it from **+**. Traits under it are never offered to the player directly. They reach play only through links.

**Custom Persona** is a mark on one entity, set on its **Profile** tab. It takes None's place at Enter World. Its traits are the player's when they play with no world persona, or with a persona from their library. Use it to give a race and a class to a player who brings their own persona.

- **Wildcard** randomizes. One of its values is picked, and every chip of it shows that pick. Good for variety, like a crowd of strangers who aren't all identical.
- **Object** holds. All of its values apply, joined together wherever it's placed. Good for a thing made of parts.
- **Variable** names either kind while it has one value. It always resolves to that value, so changing it here updates every chip.

New placeholders start as Wildcards, and one you have never touched reads as the kind its value count already implies.

**Parts.** A value that is exactly one chip is a **part** of the placeholder holding it, addressable as \`Name › Part\`. That is how an Object is built out of other placeholders.

**World vs. Unique** (Wildcards only). Each chip you place chooses how its roll is shared:

- **Unique** rolls on its own for each placement. Ten Unique chips of *Eye Color* give ten independent eyes.

**The roll is frozen for the playthrough.** A Wildcard is rolled once, when a game begins, and stored in that save. The stranger who had gray eyes on turn one still has them on turn ninety, and reloading the save changes nothing. A new game rolls fresh.

**Where chips work.** Anywhere with the chip picker: entity, location and dictionary descriptions, the readme, the world's AI-Facing Description. They resolve both in what the AI reads and in what the player sees. The world's **Player-Facing Description is the exception.** It's read in the library before any game exists, so there are no rolls yet, and it takes no chips.

**Built-in chips.** The \`{\` menu also offers **Player Name** and, in an entity's own fields, **Character Name**. They need no placeholder of their own.

**Placeholders are Advanced-only.** The editor's mode switch has to be on Advanced for this tab and the chip palette to appear.

Define a placeholder here, then place its chip from any field that offers them. A placeholder with no values resolves to nothing, so give it at least one.`,

        body: `A **blueprint** is a placeholder that exists to be copied, like *Class Garb*. Add the **Blueprints** group from **+**, then move a placeholder into it. Each entity that needs the blueprint gets its own **copy**, so one *Class Garb* reads a different value on each character.

**Copies appear by themselves.** When a trait on an entity pins or places a blueprint, that entity gets a copy, named like *Albus.Class Garb*. A top-level trait makes one for every Persona entity and for the Custom Persona entity. An untouched copy goes away with its last use. One you edited stays.

**A copy follows its blueprint until you edit it.** You can reword a value, change its weight, add a value only this entity has, or remove one. Values the blueprint gains later reach every copy. **Reset** returns one value, and **Reset to Blueprint** returns them all.

**Blueprint chips** read the bearer's own copy, and they show a link glyph. Write one *Paladin* description with a *Class Garb* chip, and each Paladin reads their own garb. They work only in an original trait's text and in blueprint and copy values, because the chip needs a bearer to read.

**A blueprint is never a World placeholder.** A move out of the group is refused while a trait, a value or a copy uses it, and the notice names each use.`,

    body: `The numbers that describe your player: health, coin, reputation, whatever your world needs. Each stat has a value between a **Min** and **Max**, and the AI sees them every turn and lets them color how each action turns out.

Stats give the story a memory with consequences. Prose alone forgets. A stat is a fact the AI has to write around: a low one shows up as effort and cost, a high one as ease. The narrator is told to work them into events rather than announce them, so stats shape the story without reading like a spreadsheet.

**What the AI sees.** Each stat's **Name** is always sent. The Stats chip in your prompt picks what is sent with it:

- **Range** sends the current number and its ceiling, like \`62/100\` (or \`62%\` for a percentage stat)
- **Descriptor** sends the matching **Stat Descriptor**, a word for the current level
- **Description** sends the stat's **Description**, what it represents

**The fields**

- **Type** is **Number** or **Percentage**. A Number stat spans a range you set. A Percentage stat is pinned from 0 to 100 and shown everywhere as \`N%\`. Everything below works the same for both. A percentage stat fixes the range for you and drops the Max, so you only set its **Initial Value (%)**.
- **Min / Max / Initial Value** set the range and where the stat starts. (A percentage stat locks Min/Max at 0/100 and shows just Initial Value.)
- **Regen** is added for each hour of story time, then clamped to the range. With **Measured Clock** off, each turn is one hour. A positive number heals over time, a negative one drains.
- **Availability** has **Enabled**, which keeps the stat active, and **Hidden**, which hides it from the player while the AI still reads it
- **Stat Descriptors** turn a number into a word. A threshold is a **value of this stat** (on a 0–10 stat, \`3\` means 3) and it is the *top* of its band, so the lowest band the value fits in wins, whatever order you list them in. Give the highest one a threshold of your **Max**, or a value above it gets no descriptor at all. The coverage bar draws every band's real extent with the gap above them in red, and each row says what it covers. Switch **Thresholds in** to **% of Max** if you'd rather the bands rescale when you change the range. Your numbers are converted as you switch, so nothing moves.
- **Prevent AI Changes** locks a stat against the AI in one direction. Useful for anything only your world's rules should move.
- **Body Sliders** bind a body morph to the stat, so its value sets the slider from Min to Max
- **Dynamic Value Calculation** runs a small script that can set the value, Min, Max, or Regen, pin a placeholder, or switch a trait. It has a **?** of its own beside it.

**Simple mode hides** Availability, Stat Descriptors, Prevent AI Changes and Dynamic Value Calculation. Switch the editor to Advanced to use them.

Start with two or three stats that the story would genuinely depend on. Every stat you add spends context on every turn, whether it matters to the scene or not.`,
  },
  'worldEditor.statCode': {
    title: 'Dynamic Value Calculation',
    wikiPage: 'StatCodeGuide',
    wikiAnchor: '-stat-code-guide',
    body: `A stat can run a small script. Write JavaScript. A returned number replaces the stat's value. A script with no return can still set \`self\`, pin a placeholder, or switch a trait. Leave a box empty and the manual value stands.

**Two boxes, one turn.** Turn order:

| | |
|---|---|
| 1 | **Before the AI** |
| 2 | AI stat changes |
| 3 | Regen |
| 4 | **After the AI** |

**Before the AI** runs at the start of the turn, before the prompt is built. A value it sets, a placeholder it pins, or a trait it switches is in the prompt for that turn. \`previous\` reads as the stat itself, every \`delta\` reads zero, and the clock reads turn start.

**After the AI** runs after the AI's changes and Regen apply. It reads the values the before box set. Both boxes run every turn. An empty box is skipped. A bound set by one box persists until the other box writes it or both boxes are empty.

The **Test Code** button under each box runs that box alone on that box's clock: the opening turn for Before the AI, a one-hour turn on day one for After the AI. Test Code executes the code. Editor underlines are static analysis only.

**What the script can reach.** A copy of every stat, the world's placeholders, and the world's traits. The sandbox exposes nothing else. \`stats\` is a map keyed by name. \`self\` is the stat that owns the code. Each stat carries \`id\`, \`name\`, \`type\`, \`description\`, \`min\`, \`max\`, \`value\` and \`regen\`.

\`\`\`js
const health = stats.Health.value;
return health / 2;
\`\`\`

A name with a space needs brackets: \`stats["Hit Points"]\`. \`Object.values(stats)\` iterates every stat. A name with a placeholder chip reads in code as that placeholder's name, so a stat named \`{{Beast}} Power\` is \`stats["Beast Power"]\` in every playthrough.

**Writing to \`self\`.** Set \`self.value\`, \`self.min\`, \`self.max\` or \`self.regen\` and the stat takes that number this turn. A bound the code sets persists until the code writes it again or both boxes are empty. A field the code doesn't write keeps the turn's value, so a script can set the cap and leave the value to the AI. Only \`self\` accepts writes. Every other stat is read-only.

\`\`\`js
const level = stats.Level.value;
self.max = level * 10;
\`\`\`

**Reading this turn.** Each stat carries the turn's state before the code ran. \`previous\`: the full stat (\`id\`, \`name\`, \`type\`, \`description\`, \`min\`, \`max\`, \`value\` and \`regen\`) at the start of the turn. \`delta\`: every change the turn made. \`delta.ai\` is the AI's requested change. \`delta.regen\` is the regen change. \`delta.total\` is their sum. \`delta.actual\` is current values minus \`previous\`. Each has \`value\`, \`min\`, \`max\` and \`regen\`. \`previous\` and \`delta\` are read-only. Use them to clamp or scale the AI's change before it applies.

\`\`\`js
self.value = self.previous.value + Math.min(self.delta.ai.value, 10);
\`\`\`

**Placeholders.** \`placeholders\` holds the world's own placeholders by name. An entity's or a dictionary's placeholders are on its entry: \`entities.Molly.placeholders\`, \`persona.placeholders\` and \`dictionaries.Weather.placeholders\`. Each entry has \`values\`, every authored value as text; \`value\`, the current value; \`text\`, the value the prompt sees; and \`roll()\`, one weighted draw. On a Wildcard or a Variable, \`value\` is one text and \`text\` is the same text. On an Object, \`value\` is the list of current values and \`text\` joins them with \`", "\`. Compare narration wording with \`text\`. \`pin(x)\` pins the placeholder until the code changes it again. \`unpin()\` restores the other pins and the roll. \`pin\` takes the same shape \`value\` reads: one text on a Wildcard, a list on an Object. One text on an Object pins a one-item list. A name with a space needs brackets: \`placeholders["Hair Color"]\`.

**Paths.** Code reaches a placeholder by the path the editor shows. A placeholder that holds parts carries them as members, to any depth. Each placeholder has one path: a part's bare name doesn't reach it. Every placeholder has \`values\`, \`value\`, \`text\`, \`roll\`, \`pin\` and \`unpin\`, so a part with one of those names is shadowed by the member.

\`\`\`js
placeholders.Mood.pin(self.value < 20 ? 'furious' : 'calm');
placeholders.Hair.pin(['gray', 'cropped short']);
placeholders.Hair.Shade.pin('ash');
entities["Old Molly"].placeholders["Eye Color"].pin('green');
\`\`\`

**Traits.** \`traits\` holds every trait in the world's own trait list by name, Blueprint items included. A trait an entity owns is not in it. Each entry has \`enabled\`, true when the player has the trait and it is on, and \`acquired\`, true when the player has the trait. Both read the player's state only. Set \`enabled\` to switch the trait on or off after the run, with the same effect as the player's checkbox, exclusive siblings included. Enabling a trait the player never took acquires it. Code ignores **Player Can Toggle In-Game**, so it can switch a trait the player can't toggle. A trait name with a placeholder chip reads in code as that placeholder's name, so a trait named \`{{Beast}} Fury\` is \`traits["Beast Fury"]\` in every playthrough.

\`\`\`js
traits.Cursed.enabled = self.value <= 0;
\`\`\`

**Clock.** \`clock\` is a read-only object that describes the story time:

| | |
|---|---|
| \`clock.deltaHours\` | Story hours **this** turn consumed |
| \`clock.elapsedHours\` | Total story hours so far, counting this turn |
| \`clock.day\` | Day number at the **end** of the turn |
| \`clock.daypart\` | Time of day at the **end** of the turn |
| \`clock.previous.day\` | Day number at the **start** of the turn |
| \`clock.previous.daypart\` | Time of day at the **start** of the turn |

Both ends are given because a turn spans time: an eight-hour sleep begins in the afternoon and ends at night. Dayparts are \`night\`, \`dawn\`, \`morning\`, \`midday\`, \`afternoon\`, \`evening\`. With **Measured Clock** off, \`clock.deltaHours\` is \`1\`.

This enables a per-hour drain (\`current + 2 * clock.deltaHours\`) or a stat that only rises after dark.

**The code runs every turn.** Both boxes run on the opening turn and on a turn with no AI stat change. They run when the stat request is off or fails. On those turns \`delta.ai\` reads zero in the after box, as it always does in the before box.

**A script that sets the value overrides the AI.** The AI's write is recomputed away. The AI still reads the value and description. A script that only writes a bound, a placeholder or a trait leaves the value to the AI.

**A failed run changes nothing.** Code that throws or times out leaves the stat, the placeholders and the traits unchanged. A write to an unknown placeholder or trait name is ignored. Test Code and the Test Bench both report it.

**Templates.** The **Templates** menu beside each Test Code button inserts common code shapes. Each box offers the templates that match its timing. Before the AI: a placeholder pin, a trait switch, an opening value. After the AI: a drain, a timer, a blend of two stats, a bound from another stat, a bonus or penalty from a persona's or an entity's trait. Each template asks only for its inputs and inserts plain code you can edit.`,

    body: `Your world's lorebook. Each **book** holds **entries**, and an entry injects its content into the AI's prompt whenever one of its keywords shows up in the scanned text.

The AI can't hold your whole world in mind at once. Rather than spending context on every detail every turn, the Dictionary keeps lore on standby and pays for it only when it's relevant. Someone mentions the Gloamwater, and the AI knows what it is.

**What gets scanned.** The rule is short: **if the AI is told it, it can fire a trigger.** Each turn the scan covers:

- the **scene as the AI receives it**: your location and the entities present, plus any **nearby or sub-location** detail your prompt sends. Keywords match the exact wording the AI gets, so where a block is sent as a summary, the summary is what's matched;
- your **notes** and the **action** you just took;
- **earlier turns**, both your actions and the AI's replies, as far back as the entry's **Scan Depth** allows. All of them by default, none at 0.

Text that's present every single turn is deliberately left out: your world's AI-Facing Description, stats, traits, and formatting guidance. Its terms would otherwise fire constantly.

**The controls**

- **Trigger Keywords** fire an entry. Press Enter after each keyword. List as many as you like, and any single match is enough.
- **Always Inject** skips the scan and sends the entry every turn. Use it sparingly, since it costs context every turn.
- **Secondary Keywords** add a condition: *bridge* fires only if *toll* also appears in the scanned text
- **Background** and **Foreground** are two separate lore blocks placed in the system prompt. Drag an entry between a book's two groups to move it. By default, Background comes earlier than Foreground.
- **Recursive** entries can also be fired by the content of entries that already activated, not just by the scene
- **Books** group related entries: their order sets injection order, and disabling one mutes everything in it. Players may override those toggles before starting.

**Simple mode hides** Always Inject, Regex, Recursive, Scan Depth and Secondary Keywords, along with the Background/Foreground split and the enable toggles. Switch the editor to Advanced to use them.

Start with one book and a few entries. Use the extra controls only when an entry fires when it shouldn't.`,
