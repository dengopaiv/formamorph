/**
 * Reveal a search hit: scroll it into view and mark it, without taking focus.
 *
 * The editor's fields are rendered by a dozen managers with no shared handle on the DOM, so the hit is
 * located by its text rather than by a wired-up ref: the first control under `root` whose content holds
 * the matched string wins, skipping anything inside a `data-editor-find-skip` subtree (the find bar and
 * the list's own filter box). A miss costs only the marker — the tab switch and item selection have
 * already put the author in front of the right panel.
 *
 * Focus stays in the find bar throughout, so typing a query and stepping through hits never redirects
 * keystrokes into the world. That rules out a selection as the marker, since a browser paints one only
 * in the focused control; instead a prose field highlights the matched run through the Highlight API and
 * every field gets a ring, so the hit is visible either way.
 *
 * The lookup retries a few times because selecting an item remounts its manager, so the field usually
 * does not exist yet when the navigation happens. Retries are timer-driven rather than frame-driven:
 * `requestAnimationFrame` stops firing in a tab that isn't compositing, which would strand the reveal.
