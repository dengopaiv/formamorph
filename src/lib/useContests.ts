/**
 * Every contest a player may browse — the one running now and the archives behind it.
 *
 * Read from the shared events cache rather than per surface: the main menu holds this open for the whole
 * session and the browser asks again on every open, and the archive is a list that only ever grows. A
 * read inside the cache's window is answered from memory; past it, what is held is shown at once and the
 * fresh answer arrives behind it, which is how a podium announced mid-session reaches an open browser.
 *
 * A failed read leaves the list empty, so the tab simply doesn't appear.
 *
 * `loaded` tells an empty list apart from one that has not been read yet, which is the difference
 * between "this server runs no contests" and "the answer is still coming" — the tab is aimed at from
 * the event banner, and bouncing off it while the read is in flight would undo the click.
 *
 * @param open - Whether the surface holding the tab is on screen
