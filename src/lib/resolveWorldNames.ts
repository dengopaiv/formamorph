 * Name fields resolve at the source rather than at each point of use. Gameplay reads names for three
 * different jobs — matching them against AI prose, keying maps and deltas by them, and showing them to the
 * player — and a name that resolved for only some of those would have the player and the AI talking about
 * different characters. Handing the whole world through here once means every consumer downstream sees one
 * name, and none of them has to know placeholders exist.
 *
 *
 * Every mapper returns the **original array and item references** when nothing contained a chip. That keeps
 * these safe to call unconditionally: a world with no placeholders costs one regex test per field and
 * produces no new object identities, so downstream memos and render paths are untouched.
