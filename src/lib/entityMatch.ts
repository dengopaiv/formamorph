 *
 * Matching rules (per name):
 * - **Single-word** name: counts only when it occurs with an **initial capital** (proper-noun use), so a
 *   name that is also a common word (Hope, Will, Rose, Crow) doesn't match ordinary lowercase prose.
 * - **Multi-word** name: the words in order within a short window (so "Emily J. Foster" counts but two
 *   unrelated sentences sharing a word do not), or (partial) a *distinctive* word used as a proper noun —
 *   so "Emily" marks "Emily Foster" present. The capital guard keeps lowercase common-word usage out.
 * - Plurals match via `pluralize` (irregulars included: Wolf↔Wolves, City↔Cities); blank names skipped. A sub-3-char word (e.g. surname "Wu") is
 *   below the significance floor, so a bare "Wu" won't match "Ling Wu" — the in-order pass still does.
 * - Pass `partial: false` for consumers where a false positive has real consequences (the visitor pull,
 *   which relocates an authored NPC); that drops the single-word partial pass, leaving in-order matching.
