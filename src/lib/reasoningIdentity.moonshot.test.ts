/**
 * Moonshot is the one first-party host whose model id decides both the dialect and whether the model may be
 * switched off. Every case here names a fixed host and a fixed model id, so none of it reaches the network.
 *
 * Sources, read live on 2026-09-15: Kimi's chat API reference at platform.kimi.ai. k3 takes `reasoning_effort`
 * with `low`, `high`, and `max`, and always reasons. k2.6 switches thinking with `thinking.type`. k2.7-code
 * accepts `enabled` alone and errors on `disabled`.
