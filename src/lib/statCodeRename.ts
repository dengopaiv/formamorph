/**
 * What a rename owes the stat code that already names the thing.
 *
 * The maps the sandbox injects are keyed by name, so a stat, placeholder, or trait that gets a new name
 * leaves every `stats.Health`, `placeholders['Mood']`, or `traits.Brave` in the world pointing at nothing.
 * A placeholder reaches further still: it names the code name of every stat and trait whose own name
 * carries it as a chip, and it is a step of every `placeholders` path that passes through it. These
 * functions find all of that and rewrite it, pure over the code text, so the editor's offer, its tests, and
 * anything later that wants the same rewrite all read one implementation.
 *
 * Only the exact map-lookup forms are touched: a dot or a plain string key hanging off the map's own name.
 * A comparison against the name, a key an escape hides, and a key only a run could compute are all left
 * alone, because rewriting them would need judgment the Test Bench is the net for.
