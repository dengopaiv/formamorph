/**
 * Shared request/response client for our web workers. Lazily spins up a single worker, tags each
 * request with a unique id, and resolves/rejects the matching promise when the worker replies with
 * `{ type: 'success' | 'error', id, result?, error? }`.
 *
 * Pass a factory that constructs the worker — kept as a literal
 * `new Worker(new URL('./x.ts', import.meta.url))` at the call site so Vite can statically bundle it.
