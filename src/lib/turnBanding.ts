/**
 * Pure core of Slice 2 memory banding: turns the flat chat history into a budgeted, layered history.
 *
 * The result is full where it matters and condensed where it doesn't:
 *   1. Recent **verbatim floor** — the last K turns, always full (guaranteed), each its own
 *      user/assistant pair.
 *   2. **Rehydration** — older turns the current action lexically touches, restored to full text
 *      (best-effort, from whatever budget is left).
 *   3. **Digest band** — remaining older turns' summaries merged into ONE leading exchange: a recap
 *      question as the user line, the digests joined as the assistant reply (oldest dropped if the
 *      band overflows). Digests must NOT ride as per-turn pairs: a history of many short "own replies"
 *      drags small models into matching that length — measured on a real collapsed turn, paired
 *      digests averaged 40 words/turn vs ~125 for the merged recap exchange (digest-framing-probe.mjs).
 *      Framed as a recap answer, the short style reads as a different task, not a narration exemplar.
 *   4. Drop — older turns with no summary, or beyond budget.
 *
 * A digest is still only a pointer: when an old turn matters again it's rehydrated from its real text,
 * so a hallucinated summary is never load-bearing. Kept React-free so the index/budget math is
 * unit-testable.
