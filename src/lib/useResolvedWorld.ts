/**
 * The authored world with every name resolved — the one place gameplay should read it from.
 *
 * A name is read for three different jobs (matched against AI prose, used as a map or delta key, and shown
 * to the player), so resolving per use would guarantee drift. This resolves once and hands back the same
 * shapes, which is what makes the many downstream sites correct without knowing placeholders exist.
 *
 * **Reach for this instead of `useGameData()` anywhere below GameViewer.** Reading the context directly gets
 * the authored values with their chips still in them; that is only correct for roll priming, which has to
 * see the chips it is rolling for.
 *
 * Pins are derived from the *authored* world on purpose: the active traits, the current location and each
 * stat's band are decided by id and by number, so they can be known before resolution exists — which breaks
 * the cycle, since the pins those sources carry are an input to resolution itself. Live pins, not the
 * paged-back turn's: stat deltas are keyed by resolved name in the live turn, so a name resolved with a past
 * turn's pins would stop matching them.

 * checks boxes. Pins mask a roll and never overwrite it, so the roll underneath survives an unchecked box.
