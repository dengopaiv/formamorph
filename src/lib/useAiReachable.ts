 * pointed at LM Studio while the model name is still `default`.
 *
 * Everything else is deliberately allowed through, because a name being absent from the list does NOT
 * mean the request fails — LM Studio serves whatever is loaded when it doesn't recognize the name, and
 * llama.cpp behaves the same way. Guessing otherwise locks people out of a working setup, which is the
 * worse error. Proves the server is up and could route the request; not that the model generates.
