 * Dashed and muted for free implicit travel, solid and primary-colored for an authored Connection. The chosen
 * shape rides on the edge itself, so changing it redraws the map through the same path every other edit takes.
 *
 * `selected` thickens the arrow whose record is open, and `interactive` is what says an arrow answers a click
 * at all — the player's Map draws the same travel structure as something to read rather than to edit.
