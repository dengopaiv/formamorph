/**
 * Renders text as GitHub-flavored Markdown via Streamdown, which formats incomplete markdown as it
 * streams in. Used for AI narration and for world descriptions. `controls={false}` hides Streamdown's own
 * table and code buttons; the help window adds its own code toolbar through `components`.
 *
 * `animate` runs the per-word entrance animation on newly-streamed words (used for the live narration
 * reveal; off for committed/static text so it doesn't re-animate on pagination). `animation` is the
 * Streamdown keyframe name (e.g. `moveIn`) and `easing` its timing function; timing (duration/stagger)
 * comes from the model's smoothed rate. Move/Grow/Stretch also read `--rl-*` vars + transform-origin
 * from the narration container (set by the caller).
 *
 * `tinted` turns on the author-side chip highlighting: the caller marks up resolved placeholder values and
 * they come back as chip-colored marks. Off everywhere the player reads.
 *
 * `dialogue` wraps quoted speech in a span the stylesheet colors. On for story text — narration and the
 * player's own echoed lines — and off for the reasoning aside, the command preview, and every pane outside
 * the game view.
 *
 * `components` replaces the renderer of the tags it names, such as the reader's links. Pass a stable
 * object: Streamdown memoizes each block on its identity.
 *
 * `timing` is the word timing of a reveal with its own pace, such as a help answer. Without it the
 * renderer reads the narration timing store.
