 * painted over the [prev, cur] region on top. `delta` is the signed change the band represents (`cur − prev`);
 * `draining` collapses last turn's band back toward the current value on submit (accent unmoved), leaving a
 * clean bar before the next turn grows. Geometry is the pure `statBarFrame`; under reduced-motion everything
 * snaps to its final state (no slide/grow, no drain band). `animKey` re-triggers the animation when the
 * value+delta coincide between turns (e.g. scrolling between two past turns) — pass the page number.
