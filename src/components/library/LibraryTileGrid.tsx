 * @param placeholderOf - The art for an item with no thumbnail, in folders and under a carried tile
 * @param groupSettings - Settings shown in the folder header; omit on tabs that carry none

 * @param toolbar - Controls for this tab's view, drawn above the grid
 * @param filter - Shows only the items it passes, and folders holding one. The view packs them in the saved
