 * author agrees to these by publishing into the contest, so the wording they see at that moment has to
 * be the same wording the tab shows everyone else.
 *
 * It opens under the poster's own header band, organizer color and all, so the rules are visibly the
 * same event the poster announced rather than a second thing with the same name.
