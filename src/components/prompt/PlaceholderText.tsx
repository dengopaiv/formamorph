 * name with its letter — so a row and the field it opens agree on what a thing is called. What the chip
 * will become, and its mode, go in the tooltip. Colors are the same per-placeholder accents the palette
 * uses, so a pill and the chip you inserted match.
 *
 * A chip whose definition was deleted renders a red `?`, and so does one that drills through a part that
 * was deleted — either way the chip resolves to nothing. Deliberately unlike {@link describePlaceholders},
 * which resolves the same case to `''` because a text surface has nowhere to hang the explanation.
 *
 * Text with no chips renders as plain text and costs one regex test, so this is safe to use for every row.
