# Formamorph Design System

This guide and the live showcase are the visual authority for Formamorph. They document approved patterns; they do not authorize an app-wide redesign.

> **Open the live reference:** run the development app, then open `#dev?modal=designSystem` or call `window.__fmDev.goto(undefined, { modal: 'designSystem' })`.

The showcase uses production components and local demonstration state. It does not save preferences or call an endpoint, and its lazy route is excluded from production builds.

## Visual foundations

Use semantic values from the app. Do not sample colors from screenshots; HDR and display processing can change them.

| Foundation | Approved source | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Color | [`src/index.css`](../src/index.css) | Use `background`, `foreground`, `card`, `muted`, `accent`, `border`, `input`, `ring`, and semantic status tokens. Palettes override every value except the semantic status tokens, which come from the base light and dark blocks and stay constant across palettes. |
| Typography | [`tailwind.config.js`](../tailwind.config.js) and [`typography.tsx`](../src/components/ui/typography.tsx) | Choose the role: `display`, `heading`, `title`, `body`, `label`, `helper`, or `meta`. Use `Hint`, `FieldError`, `SectionTitle`, and `Meta` for secondary text. |
| Font | [`src/index.css`](../src/index.css) defines `--app-font`, [`SettingsContext.tsx`](../src/contexts/SettingsContext.tsx) sets it, and [`tailwind.config.js`](../tailwind.config.js) puts it in the sans stack. The font registry stays in [`settingsDefaults.ts`](../src/contexts/settingsDefaults.ts). | Inherit `--app-font`. Production font choices and per-font tuning remain authoritative. |
| Borders and radius | [`src/index.css`](../src/index.css) | Use `border`, `input`, and `--radius`; use `h-hairline` or `w-hairline` for dividers. |
| Spacing | Production component classes | Compose the existing 4-unit rhythm: 1rem between rows and 1.5rem between sections in settings surfaces. |
| Focus | Production controls in [`src/components/ui`](../src/components/ui) | Keep the shared two-pixel inset `ring` treatment. Do not replace it with a palette-specific outline. |

Cards use `card` rather than inventing a second panel color. Destructive, success, warning, and information states keep their semantic colors across palettes.

## Pattern: Aligned Settings Stack

**Purpose:** Make a mixed settings form easy to scan while giving controls most of the horizontal space.

**Density:** Comfortable. Sections have 1.5rem between them; rows within a section have 1rem. Controls keep their production heights and typography roles.

### Composition

- Group related rows with a small uppercase section title and a hairline divider.
- At `sm` and wider, use a 1:3 label/control grid. Right-align labels and keep controls left-aligned.
- Below `sm`, stack the label above the control and left-align both.
- Put a short description below its control or beside a checkbox. Keep necessary detail behind the information control.
- Use several suitable widget types. Do not convert every setting into the same control for visual uniformity.
- Use the responsive option switcher for mutually exclusive choices: segmented options at `sm` and wider, a select below `sm`.
- Keep long values inside the control column. Select triggers truncate instead of widening the row.

### Production mapping

| Need | Component |
| --- | --- |
| Section heading and divider | `Section` in [`SettingsRows.tsx`](../src/components/SettingsRows.tsx) |
| Label/control alignment | `Row` and `RowLabel` in [`SettingsRows.tsx`](../src/components/SettingsRows.tsx) |
| Checkbox plus description | `CheckRow` in [`SettingsRows.tsx`](../src/components/SettingsRows.tsx) |
| Segmented desktop / select mobile | `OptionSwitcher` in [`SettingsRows.tsx`](../src/components/SettingsRows.tsx) |
| Slider plus current value | `ValueSlider` in [`SettingsRows.tsx`](../src/components/SettingsRows.tsx) |
| Optional detail | `HintInfo` in [`SettingsRows.tsx`](../src/components/SettingsRows.tsx) |
| Inputs and choices | `Input`, `Checkbox`, `Slider`, `Select`, and `ToggleGroup` in [`src/components/ui`](../src/components/ui) |
| Approved compositions | Display and Output in [`SettingsModal.tsx`](../src/components/modals/SettingsModal.tsx) |

### State reference

| State | Treatment |
| --- | --- |
| Default | Show a valid initial value with the normal border and text roles. |
| Selected | Use the production selected fill, foreground, and shadow. Do not add a second selection mark unless the control already has one. |
| Disabled | Keep the value readable, reduce opacity, and explain why it is unavailable when the reason is not evident. |
| Focus | Use the shared visible focus ring. Keyboard focus must not rely on hover. |
| Validation | Set `aria-invalid`, connect the message with `aria-describedby`, and use `FieldError`. |
| Overflow | Constrain the control column and preserve the full value through its menu, title, or detail view. |

The live Settings reference shows all six states. Its Display and Output examples reuse the same rows, options, theme registries, font registries, and controls as production.

## Pattern: Focused Markdown Authoring

**Purpose:** Keep long-form source editing dense while making the rendered result one clear switch away.

**Density:** Compact controls, comfortable content. Toolbar buttons use the production 1.75rem control height and one-unit gaps; the editor uses the `label` text role (0.875rem, 1.25rem line height) with 0.75rem horizontal and 0.5rem vertical surface padding, plus a substantial scrollable work area.

### Composition

- Put the field label above the toolbar so the complete toolbar can use the control row.
- Keep common inline actions visible: bold, italic, strikethrough, inline code, and blockquote.
- Group highlight, heading, list, and insertion choices as split buttons. The face runs the current action; the chevron opens the group.
- Keep each split button visually joined, including its internal divider. Put the formatting group at the left and history at the row end; one hairline separates history from the view controls.
- Put Edit and Preview in one two-option selector. The selected view uses the shared active-tab treatment.
- Use realistic content that includes headings, links, emphasis, lists, tasks, quotes, tables, and code. Keep the editing area bounded so long prose demonstrates vertical overflow.
- Keep demonstration text in local component state. A reference editor must not save authored data or call an endpoint.

### Production mapping

| Need | Component |
| --- | --- |
| Editor, toolbar, history, fullscreen, and views | `PromptField` with `markdown` in [`PromptField.tsx`](../src/components/prompt/PromptField.tsx) |
| Markdown operations and selected-text ranges | [`markdownToolbar.ts`](../src/lib/markdownToolbar.ts) and [`promptFieldState.ts`](../src/components/prompt/promptFieldState.ts) |
| Rendered output | `MarkdownRenderer` in [`MarkdownRenderer.tsx`](../src/components/game/MarkdownRenderer.tsx) |
| Split-button dropdown | `Popover` in [`src/components/ui`](../src/components/ui) |
| Edit/Preview selector | `Tabs` in [`src/components/ui`](../src/components/ui) |
| Tooltips and focus names | `Tip` in [`tooltip.tsx`](../src/components/ui/tooltip.tsx) |

### Split-button behavior

The face starts with the first action in its group. Choosing a dropdown item applies it and makes it the face's current action for the rest of that mounted editor session. Toolbar presses retain editor focus and selection, so formatting applies to the selected text and leaves the transformed range selected.

### Responsive behavior

At desktop widths, the toolbar stays compact and wraps only when its container requires it. A sufficiently wide full-screen editor can place Edit and Preview side by side. At mobile widths, controls wrap without horizontal page overflow; tapping the inline editing surface opens the production full-screen editor, where Edit and Preview become swipeable panes with position dots.

### State reference

| State | Treatment |
| --- | --- |
| Selected | Edit or Preview uses the shared active-tab fill and foreground. Text selection remains visible while a toolbar action runs. |
| Disabled | Formatting and history controls disable in Preview; undo and redo also disable when their stacks are empty. |
| Focus | Toolbar controls and tabs use the shared focus ring; the editable surface keeps its native caret and selection. |
| Overflow | The editor and preview scroll inside their bounded surface. Tables keep their own overflow behavior rather than widening the page. |

The live Markdown reference reuses the complete production editor. It demonstrates the compact groups, separators, split-button current actions, long-content overflow, local editing, and rendered preview without a showcase-only toolbar.

## Pattern: Image-Led Community Creation Cards

**Purpose:** Let readers scan community creations through their artwork while keeping the name, author, summary, social proof, and secondary actions easy to find.

**Density:** Compact. Artwork dominates the first impression; the details beneath it fit a description, one three-part count row, and up to two rows of tags before an overflow disclosure.

### Composition

- Keep the creation title and author on its thumbnail over the shared title scrim. A long title expands to three lines on hover and keeps its full value in a tooltip when clipped.
- Put a concise description below the art, then align likes, downloads, and comments across one row.
- Put tags after counts. Show two rows in the resting card and disclose the remainder on hover rather than making every card taller.
- Keep the contextual download control in the art’s top-right corner. Other secondary actions remain in their established contextual placements.
- Use controlled callbacks in the showcase. The reference never opens a listing, publishes, downloads, deletes, or changes a like outside its local state.

### Production mapping

| Need | Component |
| --- | --- |
| Frame, artwork, title scrim, author, and description | `WorldCardShell` in [`WorldCardShell.tsx`](../src/components/WorldCardShell.tsx) |
| Community counts, tags, and contextual actions | `RemoteWorldCard` in [`RemoteWorldCard.tsx`](../src/components/community/RemoteWorldCard.tsx) |
| Favorite selection and pending state | `LikeButton` in [`LikeButton.tsx`](../src/components/community/LikeButton.tsx) |
| Tag density and overflow | `CardTags` in [`WorldDetails.tsx`](../src/components/WorldDetails.tsx) |

### Responsive behavior

At desktop widths, cards form a two-column reference grid. At narrower widths they stack at one column while preserving the image-first order, count row, wrapping tags, and minimum touch targets. Title expansion and image actions retain keyboard access; a focused image action becomes visible with the shared focus ring even without hover.

### State reference

| State | Treatment |
| --- | --- |
| Selected | A liked creation uses the production filled heart and pressed state. Selecting a card reports the local selected listing. |
| Disabled | A pending favorite callback disables the production heart until the local callback completes. |
| Focus | Thumbnail actions reveal on keyboard focus and use the shared ring. |
| Overflow | Titles clamp in the resting card and expand up to three lines on hover; a tooltip preserves clipped titles. Tags disclose after two rows. |
| Action | The update action and favorite callback report local outcomes only. |

The live Community cards reference uses the production card and shell with neutral, controlled fixtures. It covers long titles, descriptions, tags, counts, selected likes, pending actions, keyboard focus, and update affordances without touching community data.

## Pattern: Compact Find Utility Bar

**Purpose:** Search and replace across a structured editor without taking over the editing workspace.

**Density:** Compact. The floating bar keeps its search, options, counter, navigation, and close actions on one row. Replace expands beneath search without changing the surrounding editor layout.

### Composition

- Place the bar over the upper-left of a bounded editor workspace. Keep enough document context visible to show which field receives the current match.
- Join Match Case and Match Whole Word to the search input. Their pressed fills show option state without adding separate labels to the row.
- Keep Previous Match, Next Match, and Close Find as separate actions. Do not combine navigation into one split control.
- Put replacement in an expandable second row. Align its input with search and keep Replace and Replace All together at the row end.
- Show the match position and total beside navigation at desktop widths. Move the counter below the controls on narrow screens so the search input keeps useful width.
- Show the current tab, item, and field as a compact breadcrumb when room permits. The editor itself remains the visible source of truth for replacement results.
- Confirm Replace All before changing text. Keep the result notice factual and based on the completed action.

### Production mapping

| Need | Component |
| --- | --- |
| Search, options, navigation, replacement, and confirmation | `EditorFindBar` in [`EditorFindBar.tsx`](../src/components/editor/EditorFindBar.tsx) |
| Search targets, matching, text splices, and grouped writes | [`worldSearch.ts`](../src/lib/worldSearch.ts) |
| Field and Chip reveal in the authored editor | [`editorFieldFocus.ts`](../src/lib/editorFieldFocus.ts) |
| Production host and keyboard shortcuts | `WorldEditor` in [`WorldEditor.tsx`](../src/views/WorldEditor.tsx) |
| Isolated interactive reference | `FindBarReference` in [`FindBarReference.tsx`](../src/components/design-system/FindBarReference.tsx) |

### Keyboard and focus behavior

The production editor opens Find with Ctrl+F and Find and Replace with Ctrl+H. The search input receives focus when the bar opens. Enter moves to the next match, Shift+Enter moves to the previous match, and Escape closes the bar. Expanding Replace and selecting navigation actions leave focus on the action that ran. A host must return focus to a stable opener when the bar closes; the live reference demonstrates that behavior.

### Responsive behavior

At desktop widths, the bar shows the counter and current-field breadcrumb in the floating surface. At mobile widths, it uses the same controls and grouping, moves the counter beneath the main row, hides the breadcrumb, and stays inside the editor width. The editor context stacks its section list above the local fields without horizontal page overflow. Long queries and document values remain constrained by their inputs.

### State reference

| State | Treatment |
| --- | --- |
| Empty | Navigation and replacement actions are disabled; no field is selected. |
| Matches | The counter reports the current result and total; the sample marks the field that contains it. |
| No matches | The counter uses the destructive text color and navigation remains disabled. |
| Options | Match Case and Match Whole Word use their production pressed states and immediately restart navigation at the first result. |
| Boundary | Previous from the first match wraps to the last; Next from the last wraps to the first. |
| Replace | The disclosure adds the joined replacement row; Replace changes one result and Replace All requires confirmation. |
| Focus | Search receives opening focus; disclosure and navigation retain action focus; closing returns focus to the reference opener. |

The live Find reference uses the production bar and matching code against local component state. Search, navigation, option changes, and replacements update a realistic sample document without using authored-world storage or the clipboard.

### Writing review

The new description states the reference purpose. Action labels use the production Find and Replace terminology, and dynamic status text reports the selected field or the completed local action. Sample names and prose are authored content and keep their own voice. Accessible names receive the same role review as visible controls. Standalone label-fragment grammar remains unverified under the Writing Guide, and reuse here does not certify the existing production Find, replacement, confirmation, or notice copy as fully ASD-STE100 compliant.

## Pattern: Code Template Selection and Detail

**Purpose:** Help an author choose a stat Code Template, supply its parameters, inspect the generated code, and insert the result.

**Density:** Dense and task-focused. The dialog reserves one bounded window for a categorized library and a scrollable detail pane. Fields use the production control height and compact two-column grid where width permits; the generated code remains close to the parameters that change it.

### Composition

- Put Built-In and My Templates in a categorized sidebar at desktop widths. Use one template selector on mobile so the detail pane keeps useful width.
- Keep the selected template's name and explanation above its parameter form. Use the template declaration as the source of fields and defaults.
- Put required stat choices and numeric parameters in the same form. Show validation beside the affected field and connect it to the control's accessible description.
- Update the generated code preview as parameter values change. Keep the preview bounded and scrollable for long code.
- Freeze the footer below the scrolling panes. Keep Duplicate or Edit and Delete beside Insert Code according to template ownership.
- Disable Insert Code while any slot is missing or invalid. Ask for confirmation before replacing existing stat code.

### Production mapping

| Need | Component |
| --- | --- |
| Dialog shell, categorized library, detail pane, parameter form, and footer actions | `StatCodeTemplateDialog` in [`StatCodeTemplateDialog.tsx`](../src/components/modals/StatCodeTemplateDialog.tsx) |
| Slot parsing, defaults, validation, and generated code | [`statCodeTemplates.ts`](../src/lib/statCodeTemplates.ts) |
| Personal-template persistence and share packs | [`StatTemplateStorageService.ts`](../src/services/StatTemplateStorageService.ts) |
| Code editing and syntax preview | `CodeArea` and `HighlightedCode` in [`src/components/prompt`](../src/components/prompt/) |
| Production host and insertion target | `StatManager` in [`StatManager.tsx`](../src/managers/StatManager.tsx) |
| Isolated interactive reference | `CodeTemplatesReference` in [`CodeTemplatesReference.tsx`](../src/components/design-system/CodeTemplatesReference.tsx) |

### Responsive and overflow behavior

At desktop widths, the fixed-height dialog uses a 15rem library beside the detail pane. The panes scroll independently, so long template names, explanations, forms, and generated code do not move the footer. At mobile widths, the dialog fills the usable viewport, replaces the sidebar with a selector, stacks parameter fields, and keeps actions wrapping within the footer.

### State reference

| State | Treatment |
| --- | --- |
| Selected | The active desktop library item uses the shared accent fill; the mobile selector shows the same template. |
| Missing | An unanswered required stat shows `Required`, sets `aria-invalid`, and keeps insertion disabled. |
| Invalid | An unusable number shows `Must be a number`; the preview stays runnable while insertion remains disabled. |
| Valid | Completed values remove inline errors, update the preview, and enable Insert Code. |
| Focus | Dialog controls use the shared focus ring, and keyboard opening moves focus into the dialog. |
| Overflow | The library, detail pane, and generated code stay bounded and scroll rather than widening the dialog. |
| Action | Insert Code closes the dialog after writing generated code to the host callback. Personal-template and file actions use their supplied storage boundaries. |

The live Code Templates reference passes neutral sample stats and an in-memory personal-template repository to the production dialog. Insert Code updates a visible local sample target. Duplicate, edit, delete, import, and export remain available, but their reads, writes, and file transfers stay inside the mounted reference and never use the author's template database or files.

### Writing review

New reference instructions name the visible “Open Code Templates” action and local outcome messages report only completed demonstration changes. Code Template, stat, parameter, and generated code retain their product or technical meanings; sample stat names and template prose are authored demonstration content. Accessible labels keep validation in descriptions rather than changing field names. Standalone label-fragment grammar and complete technical-term admission remain unverified under the Writing Guide. Reuse does not certify the existing production dialog copy as fully ASD-STE100 compliant, and code tokens and stat sandbox semantics are unchanged.

## Pattern: Bounded Spatial Workspace

**Purpose:** Edit spatial relationships while keeping nested containment distinct from authored travel.

**Density:** Compact floating controls around a large, bounded work area. Group frames contain their children; labels and arrows share the remaining space rather than becoming a separate list.

### Composition and production mapping

| Need | Production source and treatment |
| --- | --- |
| Work area and fullscreen | [`LocationCanvas.tsx`](../src/managers/LocationCanvas.tsx): embedded view with zoom/fit controls; fullscreen adds the toolbar, search, and minimap. Drag, nesting, and the context menu's Auto Arrange work in the embedded view. |
| Nested Groups | [`locationCanvas.ts`](../src/lib/locationCanvas.ts): measured frames around child locations, including nested Groups. Containment is the frame itself, never a line. |
| Connection hierarchy | [`FloatingEdge.tsx`](../src/components/FloatingEdge.tsx) and [`canvasEdges.ts`](../src/lib/canvasEdges.ts): muted dashed arrows for implicit sibling travel; solid primary-colored arrows for authored Connections, one arrow per direction. An authored Connection replaces that pair's implicit navigation. |
| Floating tool groups | `CanvasToolbar` in the canvas: arrangement, alignment/distribution, grid/snap, Connection Style, then undo/redo, separated by hairlines. |
| Search and reveal | `LocationSearch`: names plus ancestry, keyboard result selection, and viewport reveal of deeply nested locations. |
| Zoom and orientation | [`CanvasControls.tsx`](../src/components/CanvasControls.tsx): zoom in, zoom out, and fit; the canvas supplies the fullscreen button. The fullscreen minimap also pans and navigates. |
| Manual arrangement and history | [`locationArrange.ts`](../src/lib/locationArrange.ts), [`locationAlign.ts`](../src/lib/locationAlign.ts), and [`canvasHistory.ts`](../src/lib/canvasHistory.ts): explicit edits, with a whole arrangement restored in one undo step. |
| Isolated reference | [`LocationsCanvasReference.tsx`](../src/components/design-system/LocationsCanvasReference.tsx): the production workspace with local locations, Connections, history, and preferences. |

Opening, zooming, or fitting the canvas never rewrites manual positions. Auto Arrange acts on the selected Group, or a selected child's Group; Auto Arrange All acts recursively when nothing is selected. Preserve these scopes and the existing drag/nesting and touch gestures. These are authoring commands, not background layout behavior.

### Responsive behavior and states

The reference keeps the embedded canvas inside a bounded editor panel. At desktop widths, fullscreen places search at the upper left, tool groups along the top, zoom controls at the lower left, and the minimap at the lower right. On phones, the toolbar scrolls horizontally and search moves beneath it. Use full screen and search/reveal when the whole-map overview makes names too small to read.

| State | Treatment |
| --- | --- |
| Selected | Nodes keep the production ring; selected authored arrows thicken and open the Connection inspector. |
| Disabled | Undo/redo disable at empty history boundaries; alignment needs two locations and distribution needs three. |
| Focus | Search and toolbar controls retain shared focus styling and accessible names. |
| Overflow | Long node names truncate; search rows truncate too. Only the reference's selected-location output exposes the complete name. Long Connection labels clamp in the overview and expand on selection/hover; the inspector holds the full travel hint. |
| Local edits | Moving, arranging, and editing Connections use the real handlers. Fullscreen preserves local history; leaving the reference discards the sample session. |

The reference preserves production density and panel placement. Dense labels can overlap the graph, and the floating Connection inspector can cover other controls at narrow widths; close it to return to those controls. These are reference limitations to review, not patterns to copy into new surfaces without judgment. Theme, palette, font, reduced-motion handling, and touch behavior come from production. Detailed checks and writing limits live in the [review record](../docs-internal/designs/design-system/locations-canvas-review.md).

## Pattern: Grouped Context Actions

**Purpose:** Keep related actions close to the item they affect without crowding its resting surface.

**Rule:**

- Every row is one of two kinds. A row that answers "which one?" belongs to a titled set. A row that does something belongs to a flat action set.
- A title is the flyout handle. A titled set can fold into a flyout. The title becomes the flyout label.
- Action rows never fold. They carry an icon to stay apart from set rows.
- Separators divide kinds, not topics.
- A context-dependent action section sits where the fixed action section sits. It keeps its icons.

**Density:** Compact. Menu rows use the production label size and padding; section labels use the smaller meta role. The group shortcuts are bounded, so ordinary menus do not need scrolling.

### Composition

- Start with the reversible preference section. Tile Size uses one radio group and keeps the selected-size checkmark visible.
- Align destination text with the action-label column, without repeating folder icons. Keep full accessible names and truncate shortcuts on one line; the picker exposes their full text.
- Label the grouping section Add To Group. Show the first three eligible Groups in existing order, excluding the current Group before taking three.
- Follow shortcuts with FolderPlus + Create New Group… and FolderSearch + Add To Group…. The full chooser is last in this section. Keep explanations in the dialog or help.
- Separate meaning changes with semantic separators: preference, grouping, and the final destructive action.
- Put Delete alone in the final section. Keep its production trash icon and destructive color.
- Keep Group names in their authored voice. Group tiles retain Open Group and Delete Group; assigned items retain Remove From Group in a separate section.

### Production mapping

| Need | Component |
| --- | --- |
| Full tile-triggered composition | `LibraryTileContextMenu` in [`LibraryTileContextMenu.tsx`](../src/components/library/LibraryTileContextMenu.tsx) |
| Main Menu host, Group membership, and tile preferences | `LibraryTileGrid` in [`LibraryTileGrid.tsx`](../src/components/library/LibraryTileGrid.tsx) and `useLibraryTiles` in [`useLibraryTiles.ts`](../src/lib/useLibraryTiles.ts) |
| Menu primitives, checkmarks, focus, dismissal, and touch hold | [`context-menu.tsx`](../src/components/ui/context-menu.tsx) |
| Destructive confirmation and cancellation | `ConfirmDialog` in [`ConfirmDialog.tsx`](../src/components/ConfirmDialog.tsx), controlled by [`MainMenu.tsx`](../src/views/MainMenu.tsx) |
| Isolated reference | [`MainMenuContextMenuReference.tsx`](../src/components/design-system/MainMenuContextMenuReference.tsx) |
| Canvas menu, the pattern's second production instance | `canvasMenuSections` in [`canvasMenu.ts`](../src/lib/canvasMenu.ts) and `LocationCanvas` in [`LocationCanvas.tsx`](../src/managers/LocationCanvas.tsx). Right-click the canvas in the existing [`LocationsCanvasReference.tsx`](../src/components/design-system/LocationsCanvasReference.tsx). |

### Responsive behavior

On desktop, right-click a tile or focus it and use Shift+F10 or the Context Menu key. Arrow keys move through actions, Enter activates one, and Escape closes the menu and restores focus to the tile. A primary click outside dismisses the menu without activating what is underneath.

On a touch screen, press and hold the tile. Moving the held finger far enough to begin a drag closes the menu; tapping outside dismisses it. Radix positions the bounded menu inside viewport edges. At short heights, enlarged text, or zoom, the shared ScrollArea keeps every action reachable with the same arrowless scrollbar as the picker.

### State reference

| State | Treatment |
| --- | --- |
| Default | The menu is closed and the tile keeps the normal Main Menu card treatment. |
| Checked | The selected Tile Size row has `aria-checked="true"` and the production checkmark. |
| Disabled | No current action uses a disabled row. While a world tile loads, production omits Delete instead of presenting an unavailable destructive action. |
| Focus | Keyboard opening focuses the first action; arrow navigation uses the shared focus fill and text treatment. Closing with Escape restores focus to the trigger. |
| Overflow | Long Group names truncate without losing their accessible names. Group count cannot grow the menu beyond three shortcuts. Exceptional-height overflow uses ScrollArea. |
| Destructive | Delete remains in its own final section and opens the existing confirmation. Cancel keeps the item; Confirm removes it. |

The live reference uses the production menu against a production card shell. Tile size, Group selection, Group creation, removal, deletion, and restoration stay in mounted React state. The sample never reads or writes Main Menu preferences, library records, storage, account data, or authored worlds.

### Writing review

- **Unverified:** “Right-click the sample world. On a touch screen, press and hold the sample world. For keyboard access, focus the sample world. Press Shift+F10 or the Context Menu key.” gives one action per sentence and names its target, but complete technical-term admission for “Right-click,” “touch screen,” “keyboard,” Shift+F10, and Context Menu is not recorded.
- **Unverified:** “A controlled library sample for the production tile menu.” identifies the sample in one sentence. “Restore the local sample to continue.” states the next local step, and “Restore Sample” names its action. “Grouped library tile actions” is a compact selector phrase. Vocabulary and grammar evidence is not recorded.
- **Unverified:** status cases are “The tile size is small/medium/large.”, “The sample group is {Group name}.” or “The sample is not in a group.”, and “The local sample is available/deleted.” Vocabulary and grammar evidence is not recorded; interpolated Group names are user-authored fixtures and retain their own voice.
- **Unverified:** the accessible label “Sample world: The Lantern District” has terminology and formatting review only; standalone label-fragment grammar is outside the listed evidence.

Tile Size, Add To Group, Create New Group, Remove From Group, Delete, Delete World, Cancel, and Confirm reuse production copy so the reference and Main Menu cannot drift. Reuse does not certify those labels or the confirmation as fully ASD-STE100 compliant. In particular, the existing Delete label remains unchanged for production parity; this ticket does not perform the app-wide terminology decision that would be required before replacing it.

## Pattern: Compact Selection Lists

**Purpose:** Choose one destination from a simple list without reserving room for absent controls.

Use [`CompactSelectionRow`](../src/components/ui/compact-selection-row.tsx) for simple choices. Its production values are the authority: 32px minimum height, 8px horizontal and 6px vertical padding, with no inter-row gap. Typography and wrapped names can increase row height. Do not add empty grip, icon, metadata, or action columns. Rich editor and save rows keep their useful controls and distinct density.

| State | Treatment |
| --- | --- |
| Default | Native button; full name wraps and long unbroken text remains inside the row. |
| Selected | Primary fill, contrasting text, pressed state, and an inline check. Only the selected row needs the check's space. |
| Focus | Shared inset ring; Tab reaches choices and Enter or Space activates them. |
| Disabled | Native disabled behavior and reduced opacity. |
| Empty | A concise status occupies the pane; actions remain available. |

On mobile, preserve the same text-first row and minimum height. Wrapping increases the touch area instead of clipping names. Sorting and secondary row actions belong to richer lists, not this pattern.

## Pattern: Searchable Group Picker

**Purpose:** Keep an unbounded destination list out of the quick-action menu.

[`LibraryGroupPicker`](../src/components/library/LibraryGroupPicker.tsx) composes the shared Dialog, Input, CompactSelectionRow, ScrollArea, and DialogFooter. It names the affected item, focuses Find a Group after menu teardown, and shows all Groups in their existing order. Search filters names without sorting. The current assignment has selected styling and a check; choosing it closes without an assignment write.

- Choosing another row moves the item by stable Group ID and closes the dialog. Existing duplicate names remain distinct destinations.
- Cancel, Close, and Escape leave the library unchanged and return focus to the opener. A grid that loses its original tile provides a focus fallback.
- Create New Group… opens the naming form from either entry point. Blank names and trimmed case-insensitive duplicates are rejected; corrections can be submitted with Create Group.
- Keep search and footer outside the bounded destination pane. The pane uses the shared 10px arrowless scrollbar and reserved gutter. At exceptionally short heights or enlarged text, the outer shared scroller also reveals dialog controls.
- Keep Cancel before Create in markup and together in the footer. The shared mobile footer stacks the affirmative action above Cancel; desktop places Cancel to its left.

### Production and verification mapping

| Need | Source |
| --- | --- |
| Menu and focus handoff | [`LibraryTileContextMenu.tsx`](../src/components/library/LibraryTileContextMenu.tsx) |
| Assignment and named creation | [`useLibraryTiles.ts`](../src/lib/useLibraryTiles.ts), [`operations.ts`](../src/lib/libraryOrganization/operations.ts) |
| Isolated live composition | [`MainMenuContextMenuReference.tsx`](../src/components/design-system/MainMenuContextMenuReference.tsx) |
| Behavior and storage round trip | [`LibraryGroupFlow.test.tsx`](../src/components/library/LibraryGroupFlow.test.tsx) |

Open `#dev?modal=designSystem&tab=context-menu&subtab=picker` or use `subtab=create` for the naming form. These routes use local demonstration state and production components. They do not change stored library data or ship a prototype route.

New functional labels and error/status sentences follow the [Writing Guide](Writing-Guide.md) by role. Authored names retain their voice. The [review record](../docs-internal/designs/design-system/group-picker-review.md) records behavior evidence and unresolved STE limits; brevity does not certify label grammar.

## Pattern: Lists With Controls or Metadata

**Purpose:** Preserve the information and actions needed to identify, edit, order, and manage complex items.

**Density:** Content-led. Rich rows can use the World Editor's 56px floor, inter-row spacing, grip, metadata, selection, and actions. Save rows grow when names wrap and keep their timestamp, game time, reorder grip, and actions. Do not compress either family into the 32px compact-selection pattern.

### Choose the composition by purpose

| List purpose | Composition |
| --- | --- |
| Choose one simple destination | Use `CompactSelectionRow`. Do not reserve absent control columns or add sorting. |
| Edit or order authored items | Use `SortableList`, `SortableRow`, and `EditorRow`; preserve selection, metadata, duplicate/delete controls, and the detail editor. |
| Choose and manage saved progress | Use `SaveList`; preserve the save name, timestamp, game time, Auto state, ordering, load/select action, export, and delete. |

Keep controls that change the collection outside its scrolling pane when they must remain reachable. The live Save/Load reference keeps Save Name and Save above the list; the World Editor reference keeps the selected item's editor beside or below the list. Do not nest a second vertical scroller merely to imitate a scrollbar.

### Production mapping

| Need | Component |
| --- | --- |
| World Editor row, selection, metadata, and actions | [`EditorRow.tsx`](../src/components/EditorRow.tsx) |
| World Editor sorting and item actions | [`SortableList.tsx`](../src/components/SortableList.tsx) |
| Save metadata, ordering, selection, export, and delete | [`SaveList.tsx`](../src/components/modals/SaveList.tsx) and [`LoadGameDialog.tsx`](../src/components/modals/LoadGameDialog.tsx) |
| Bounded list viewport | [`scroll-area.tsx`](../src/components/ui/scroll-area.tsx) |
| Isolated interactive examples | [`RichListReferences.tsx`](../src/components/design-system/RichListReferences.tsx) |

### Responsive behavior

At desktop widths, an editor list can sit beside its detail controls, and the two reference families can share a two-column showcase row. At mobile widths, the references stack. The selected-item editor follows its list, while Save Name and Save stack above the save pane. Long authored names truncate only where a trailing editor control must remain visible; save names wrap because their metadata and actions identify a distinct saved state. Keep every action inside the card width and retain useful touch targets.

### State reference

| State | Treatment |
| --- | --- |
| Selected | Editor rows use the production primary fill and keep their controls legible. Editing changes the selected local item. |
| Disabled | Busy save rows and their export actions retain production disabled behavior; do not remove metadata to simplify the state. |
| Focus | Rows, grips, inputs, and icon actions keep visible shared focus. Keyboard selection reveals the active item in the bounded pane. |
| Long content | Editor names truncate before actions; save names wrap above their metadata. Accessible names preserve the complete authored value. |
| Overflow | Long collections scroll inside one bounded pane. Adjacent editors, Save Name, Save, and status remain reachable outside it. |
| Action | Editing, duplication, deletion, saving, loading, exporting, and sorting use controlled callbacks in the live reference. They change mounted sample state only. |

The Rich Lists reference uses the same production row components as World Editor and Save/Load. Its fixtures contain long names, realistic types, timestamps, game time, and an Autosave. It never reads or writes authored worlds, saved games, IndexedDB, local storage, files, or endpoints.

### Writing review

The reference descriptions, control labels, dynamic status, and accessible action names were reviewed by role through the [Writing Guide](Writing-Guide.md). Authored character, location, and save names retain their voices. Standalone label grammar, complete technical-term admission, reused production copy, and dynamic substitutions remain unverified; the [review record](../docs-internal/designs/design-system/rich-lists-scrollbars-review.md) records those limits.

## Standard: Scrollbars

Use [`ScrollArea`](../src/components/ui/scroll-area.tsx) for bounded vertical content when it preserves the surface's behavior. It is the shared World Editor appearance: a 10px vertical track, rounded theme-derived thumb, no up/down chevrons, and an 11px viewport gutter so the overlay thumb does not obscure content.

- Keep one vertical scrolling owner per pane. Preserve wheel, touch, keyboard, and focus-reveal behavior.
- Give the pane a definite height or a flex-resolved height. A maximum height alone does not give the Radix viewport a scroll boundary.
- Keep search, primary inputs, and footer actions outside the list viewport when they must remain reachable while the collection scrolls.
- Preserve horizontal scrolling where content requires it. The shared viewport assumes vertical content and forces its content wrapper to block layout; do not apply it blindly to code, tables, or other horizontal scrollers.
- Native text editors, editable regions, canvases, virtualizers, drag lists, and popover-hosted scrollers can have selection, autoscroll, wheel-lock, or focus contracts. Match the appearance only where supported, and do not wrap them in a nested ScrollArea to hide native chrome.
- Use `type="always"` when the scrollbar itself communicates that a bounded reference can scroll. Other production surfaces can retain the component's normal visibility behavior.

The [scrollbar and list inventory](../docs-internal/designs/design-system/rich-lists-scrollbars-review.md) groups remaining native and specialized surfaces by limitation. It is follow-up scope, not authorization for an app-wide migration.

## Pattern: Paired Footer Actions

**Purpose:** Make acceptance predictable by keeping a negative action before its affirmative partner.

**Density:** Compact. Keep the pair together in the footer action area; unrelated navigation or utility actions need their own justified grouping.

### Composition

- Order a pair as negative | affirmative: Cancel or decline on the left, then acceptance or continuation on the right.
- Keep the pair together. Do not place unrelated controls between the negative and affirmative actions.
- Treat placement and color as separate semantics. A destructive affirmative action keeps the destructive variant in the right-hand confirmation position.
- Preserve existing labels and operation semantics. This rule changes neither what an action does nor whether it requires confirmation.
- Put the negative action before the affirmative action in keyboard order. Do not use visual ordering to create a keyboard sequence that disagrees with the controls.

### Production mapping

| Need | Component |
| --- | --- |
| Ordinary dialog pair and responsive layout | `DialogFooter`, `DialogClose`, and `Button` in [`src/components/ui`](../src/components/ui/) |
| Destructive confirmation pair | `AlertDialogFooter`, `AlertDialogCancel`, and `AlertDialogAction` in [`alert-dialog.tsx`](../src/components/ui/alert-dialog.tsx) |
| Isolated acceptance and deletion examples | [`FooterActionOrderReference.tsx`](../src/components/design-system/FooterActionOrderReference.tsx) |
| Existing alignment follow-up and copy review | [Footer action order review](../docs-internal/designs/design-system/footer-action-order-review.md) |

### Responsive and keyboard behavior

At `sm` and wider, the shared footer renders the negative action on the left and the affirmative action on the right. Below `sm`, the shared reverse-column layout puts the affirmative action above the negative action. Keep negative-first DOM order so Tab reaches Cancel or decline before acceptance or continuation at every size. When a footer intentionally constrains available width, add reverse wrapping to that footer so long labels or enlarged text put the affirmative line above the negative line. Buttons keep their labels intact, and the footer must remain inside the dialog without horizontal page overflow.

Closing through Cancel, Escape, or the close control changes no data and returns focus to a valid opener. Confirmation changes only the operation named by the dialog. The live reference keeps both outcomes in mounted sample state and never writes authored worlds, saves, library data, or settings.

### State reference

| State | Treatment |
| --- | --- |
| Disabled | Keep acceptance disabled until its required input is valid. Cancellation remains available unless an operation cannot safely stop. |
| Focus | Both actions use the shared visible focus ring. Closing returns focus to the reference opener. |
| Canceled | Cancel and Escape close the dialog without changing the sample state. |
| Confirmed | The affirmative action closes the dialog and updates only its local sample state. |
| Destructive | Delete keeps the destructive fill and confirmation semantics in the affirmative position. |
| Overflow | The pair stacks before labels force horizontal page overflow; controls remain reachable with enlarged text. |

The live Footer Actions reference demonstrates Cancel | Create Group and Cancel | Delete with production dialogs and footer controls. A constrained example uses the established Download and Embed — Works Offline label to demonstrate wrapping. Create Group starts disabled, keyboard focus moves through the negative-first action order, and the destructive example preserves its semantic treatment.

### Writing review

The reference descriptions and local status messages were reviewed by copy role against the Writing Guide. Behavior claims were exercised against the isolated callbacks. Standalone label grammar, complete vocabulary admission, and reused production labels remain unverified; the [review record](../docs-internal/designs/design-system/footer-action-order-review.md) lists those limits. Reuse does not certify the production copy as fully ASD-STE100 compliant.

## Functional writing

Keep setting descriptions to one sentence, third person, and no more than 12 words. Put necessary additional detail behind `HintInfo`. Do not claim ASD-STE100 compliance from length or tone alone; use the vocabulary, grammar, meaning, and evidence process in the [Writing Guide](Writing-Guide.md).

### Field help order

A field reads top to bottom as label, help, control. The label names the field. The `Hint` sits directly under the label and says what the field does, in one line, using only labels and registered terms as the [Writing Guide's help-line test](Writing-Guide.md) requires. The control comes last. A `HintInfo` goes beside the label, never under the control. A control never has a `Hint` after it, so a reader always knows what a field is before reaching it, and a tall control never pushes its own explanation out of view.

Two placements sit beside a control instead of above it:

- A checkbox row puts its caption after the box and its `Hint` inline after the caption, as the trait panel's Enabled by Default does.
- A status line under a list, such as an entry count or a band's covered range, is not help. It stays after what it reports on.

Apply that guide by role to all approved patterns: settings labels and information, markdown toolbar names and instructions, card action names and status messages, Find controls and status text, Code Template fields, validation and actions, and context-menu instructions, action labels and local status. Accessible text receives the same review as visible text. World introductions, creation titles, descriptions, tags, and sample Group names are authored content; these samples retain their own voice. Existing production copy is not certified by reuse in the showcase.

The foundation's [review record](../docs-internal/designs/design-system/workflow-review.md) records copy findings, evidence limits, and the two workflow demonstrations. Existing-screen alignment remains separate work.

## Pattern: Panel Tab Strip

**Purpose:** Split one editor detail panel's fields into named tabs, so a long panel fits one screen without hiding anything behind a scroll.

**Rule:**

- The strip is one row of equal columns. Every tab gets the same width, whatever its label's length.
- Each tab carries an icon and a name. The name is always on `aria-label`, so it reaches assistive technology and role queries whether or not it is drawn.
- The label gives way to its icon wherever the pane is narrow. The icon never shrinks.
- The strip is named, because the editor's own strip is on the same screen and can carry a tab of the same name.
- Mode-only tabs are filtered out of the registry before the strip renders, not disabled in place.

**Density:** Compact. The strip is 40px tall at every width. Labels use the production label role; hiding one does not change the strip's height, so the panel below it does not move.

### Composition

- One registry per panel holds the tabs in order, with the value, name, icon, and any mode flag. The strip renders from it and the dev-router ledger is guarded against it.
- The chosen tab belongs to the editor, not the panel. These panels remount per selected item, so panel-held state would reset down the list.
- When the chosen tab is unavailable in the current mode, the panel shows its first tab.

Each panel groups its fields by what kind of thing they are:

| Panel | Tabs | Advanced only |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Entity | Profile · Descriptions · Placeholders | Placeholders |
| Location | Details · Presence · Media · Pins | Pins |
| Stat | Details · Descriptors · Code | Descriptors, Code |
| Trait | Details · Stats · Pins | Pins |
| Dictionary entry | Details · Matching | Matching |

Two panels can lose their strip: Simple mode leaves the stat panel and the dictionary entry panel a single tab, which is no choice to offer, so each renders that body bare.

The dictionary entry panel splits by cadence rather than height. The panel is not tall, but its matching rules are set once and then sit between the keywords and the value on every later visit. Details holds Name, Trigger Keywords, and Value; Matching holds the rules. Whole Words and Case-Sensitive stay on Details on purpose: they are the only two matching switches Simple mode shows, they modify the keywords they sit under, and keeping them there is what leaves Simple one tab.

It is also the only one of the five with two hosts. The World Editor holds its tab in the editor's per-panel slot; the library's dictionary editor has no such slot and holds it in modal state for as long as the modal is open.

A tab name may repeat across panels, and may match a tab on the editor's own strip. The strip's own name keeps them apart: the trait panel's Stats tab and the editor's Stats tab both read as "Stats", and only "Trait Fields" says which strip you are on.

### Production mapping

| Need | Component |
| --- | --- |
| The strip itself | `PanelTabsList` in [`panel-tabs.tsx`](../src/components/ui/panel-tabs.tsx) |
| Tab, list, and panel primitives | [`tabs.tsx`](../src/components/ui/tabs.tsx) |
| Three-tab instance and its registry | `EntityManager` in [`EntityManager.tsx`](../src/managers/EntityManager.tsx) and [`entityPanelTabs.ts`](../src/views/entityPanelTabs.ts) |
| Four-tab instance and its registry | `LocationManager` in [`LocationManager.tsx`](../src/managers/LocationManager.tsx) and [`locationPanelTabs.ts`](../src/views/locationPanelTabs.ts) |
| Instance whose tab name the editor also uses | `TraitManager` in [`TraitManager.tsx`](../src/managers/TraitManager.tsx) and [`traitPanelTabs.ts`](../src/views/traitPanelTabs.ts) |
| Instance that drops its strip in Simple mode | `StatManager` in [`StatManager.tsx`](../src/managers/StatManager.tsx) and [`statPanelTabs.ts`](../src/views/statPanelTabs.ts) |
| Two-tab instance, mounted by two hosts | `DictionaryManager` in [`DictionaryManager.tsx`](../src/managers/DictionaryManager.tsx) and [`dictionaryPanelTabs.ts`](../src/views/dictionaryPanelTabs.ts) |
| Its second host | `DictionaryEditorModal` in [`DictionaryEditorModal.tsx`](../src/components/modals/DictionaryEditorModal.tsx) |
| Isolated reference | [`PanelTabStripReference.tsx`](../src/components/design-system/PanelTabStripReference.tsx) |
| Width coverage | [`entity-panel-widths.spec.ts`](../e2e/entity-panel-widths.spec.ts) |

### Responsive behavior

The pane holding these panels is not monotonic in viewport width. Below `md` the panel is the full-width detail sheet. At `md` the editor splits and the panel takes half of it. A 767px window therefore gives the panel about 715px, and an 820px window gives it about 347px.

So the label steps on at `sm`, off at `md`, and on again at `xl`. Three tabs in a 375px sheet get 105px each and four get 85px, while one row of "Descriptions" needs 137px. Two tabs get 148px each, which is why the dictionary entry strip is the one case the label would fit; it hides anyway, because a strip that keeps its labels at a width where its neighbors drop theirs reads as a different control. The same shortfall returns in the half-width pane between `md` and `xl`.

A container query would state this directly. `@tailwindcss/container-queries` is not a dependency, and these two breakpoints track the layout's own `md` switch exactly.

### State reference

| State | Treatment |
| --- | --- |
| Default | The first tab is selected and its body is the only one mounted. |
| Selected | The active trigger takes the background, foreground, and shadow from the shared tab primitive. |
| Disabled | No tab is disabled. A tab the current mode does not offer is absent from the registry instead. |
| Focus | Arrow keys move between tabs and the shared inset focus ring marks the active one. |
| Overflow | Below `sm` and between `md` and `xl`, the label is hidden rather than truncated or wrapped. The icon keeps its full size. |

The live reference renders four of the five production strips against their own registries. It leaves the stat panel out because that strip's width case is the entity panel's, three equal columns, and the reference exists to show the widths. It holds the chosen tab in mounted React state and never reads or writes authored worlds, saves, library data, or preferences.

### Writing review

- Tab names come from the four production registries, so the reference and the editor cannot drift. Reuse does not certify those names as fully ASD-STE100 compliant.
- **Unverified:** the section headings "Three Tabs", "Four Tabs", "A Tab Name the Editor Also Uses", and "Two Tabs, Two Hosts", and the four `Meta` lines, have terminology review only; vocabulary and grammar evidence is not recorded.

## UI and prototype workflow

The project `design-system` skill routes UI changes and prototypes here. Use the applicable named pattern and its production components, then inspect the result through the live reference. Agents verify established patterns themselves and report desktop/mobile states, theme/font inheritance, interaction results, and static evidence.

For a new pattern, show a proposal inside a representative Formamorph app screen at desktop and mobile sizes. Keep it separate from the approved registry until the user approves that concrete proposal. Record the approval with the artifacts before adoption.

The reference navigation uses equal flexible columns that wrap into additional rows. Every tab keeps enough width for its label, so all references remain readable and reachable without horizontal page scrolling.

## Adding an approved pattern

The live shell renders `DESIGN_SYSTEM_REFERENCES` from [`DesignSystemShowcase.tsx`](../src/views/DesignSystemShowcase.tsx). Add one definition with an ID, label, description, and production-backed component; the reference navigation and responsive shell update from that registry.

Add a matching `## Pattern:` section here with its purpose, density, desktop/mobile behavior, component mapping, and applicable states. Demonstrate a new visual pattern inside a representative Formamorph screen at desktop and mobile sizes, then get product approval before adding it to this reference.

Keep the guide and registry synchronized when an approved reference changes; retain the existing shell and shared semantic values.
