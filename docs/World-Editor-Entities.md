# 🎭 World Editor: Entities
<!-- keywords: characters, npcs, monsters, companions, cast list, items objects, bots -->
<!-- route: worldEditor.entities -->

> 🛠️ Part of the [World Editor](WorldEditor) guide.

Entities are the people, creatures and things in your world: a ferryman, an eel-smoker, a barred door. An entity belongs to one or more **Locations**. The AI reads the entities that can show up where the player is.

## Why it exists
<!-- keywords: ai forgets characters, narrator invents people, recurring character, persistent npc, keeps renaming -->

Without entities, the narrator invents a stranger, names them, and forgets both by the next turn. An entity is a fixed person or thing the story can come back to. The AI reads about it again each time the player is at one of its locations.

The default prompt introduces entities as "Characters and things that **may** appear in this location". That wording is a hint to the AI. The game doesn't enforce it, and the narrator can use anyone on the list. You can change the wording in the [prompt editor](Prompts#how-to-edit-a-prompt).

## How to Add an Entity
<!-- keywords: character, npc, create, new character, make, person, monster, companion, creature, bot, villain, love interest, pet, party member, enemy, add someone -->
<!-- route: worldEditor.entities#list-toolbar -->

1. Open the **Entities** tab.
2. Type the entity's name in the **Search or add new entities** box.
3. Select the **+** button (**Add to Entities**). In Advanced mode, the button opens a menu: select **Add Entity**.
4. The new entity opens in the panel. On the **Profile** tab, pick one or more places in **Locations**.
5. On the **Descriptions** tab, write the **AI-Facing Description**.
6. Select **Save** at the bottom of the editor.

> 💡 With the box empty, the new entity is named "New Entity". Rename it in **Name**.

To add a copy of an entity from your library, select **Add Entity** at the bottom of the editor.

## How to Import a SillyTavern Card
<!-- keywords: character, tavern, png, chub, st, bring in, load character, character card, janitor, v2 card, tavernai, bot file, convert card, risu, upload card, lorebook comes along -->
<!-- route: worldEditor.entities -->

1. On the Main Menu, open the library's **Entities** tab.
2. Select **Import Entity**.
3. Pick the card's `.png` or `.json` file.
4. The card joins your library as an entity. The card image becomes the entity's image. Its lorebook, if it has one, joins your library as a dictionary.
5. In the World Editor, open the **Entities** tab and select **Add Entity** at the bottom of the editor.
6. Select the entity, then select **Add Entity** in the window.

You can also import a card directly into a world. On the **Entities** tab, select the arrow beside **Add Entity**, then **Import Entity…**. Pick the file, keep or clear **Link through my library**, and select **Add Entity**. This route doesn't bring in the card's lorebook.

See [SillyTavern cards](#sillytavern-cards) for what each part of the card becomes.

## How to Give an Entity an Opening
<!-- keywords: first message, greeting, intro, start, character start, npc speaks first, opener, hello line, begins the scene, initial dialogue, welcome line -->
<!-- route: worldEditorEntity.openings -->

**Advanced mode only** in the World Editor.

1. Select the entity, then open its **Openings** tab.
2. Select the **+** button (**Add Opening**).
3. Write the opening's text.
4. Choose **Player Action** or **Narration**. See [Openings](World-Editor-Openings) for the difference.
5. Make sure the entity is in a **Starting Location**. Its openings draw only when it is at the player's starting location.

The world's **Openings** checkbox turns on by itself once an opening has text, unless you unchecked it. See [Entity Openings](World-Editor-Openings#entity-openings).

## The panel
<!-- keywords: pronouns, gender, profile tab, cast or playable, category, can player be them, five tabs -->
<!-- route: worldEditorEntity.profile -->

Select an entity to open its panel.

| Tab | Holds | Mode |
|---|---|---|
| **Profile** | **Name**, **Pronouns**, **Locations** and the **Image**. In Advanced mode, also **Aliases**, the **Persona** control, **Type**, **Image Tags** and the **3D Model**. | Simple and Advanced |
| **Descriptions** | **Player-Facing Description** and **AI-Facing Description**. In Advanced mode, also **AI-Facing Summary**. | Simple and Advanced |
| **Traits** | The entity's own [traits](World-Editor-Traits#entity-traits) | Advanced only |
| **Placeholders** | The entity's own [placeholders](World-Editor-Placeholders#placeholders-that-belong-to-an-entity-or-a-dictionary) | Advanced only |
| **Openings** | The entity's own openings, including Self openings for a playable entity | Advanced only |

The **Persona** control has four choices: **Cast**, **Playable**, **Persona-Only** and **Custom Persona**. It decides whether the player can play as the entity. See [Personas for Authors](Persona-Authoring#how-to-make-an-entity-playable). An entity marked **Playable**, **Persona-Only** or **Custom Persona** also shows a **Starting Location** picker: where the player starts as this persona.

## What reaches the AI
<!-- keywords: npc secret, hidden motive, character ignored, npc never appears, spoilers, does ai see image, private notes -->

An entity reaches the AI only through a location. An entity in no location never reaches the AI.

| Field | Sent? |
|---|---|
| **Name** | Always |
| **Aliases** | Yes, as "also known as" |
| **Pronouns** | Yes, beside the name and aliases |
| **AI-Facing Description** | Yes. This is the main text the AI uses. |
| **AI-Facing Summary** | Only in prompt slots that ask for the short form |
| **Type** | Yes, as a plain field |
| The entity's active traits | Yes, after its description. See [Entity Traits](World-Editor-Traits#entity-traits). |
| **Player-Facing Description** | **Never** |
| Image, Image Tags, 3D model, group, order | Never |
| The **Persona** control | Not as a field. It lets the player play as the entity. See [Personas for Authors](Persona-Authoring#how-to-make-an-entity-playable). |

> 💡 **The player reads only the Player-Facing Description, and the AI reads only the AI-Facing fields.** Put a secret in the **AI-Facing Description**. The narrator can act on it, and the player doesn't see it. The default prompt also asks the narrator not to use a name until the player can know it. That is a request to the AI, and the game doesn't enforce it.

## Descriptions and summaries
<!-- keywords: bio, backstory, personality, appearance, short version, auto generate text, sparkle button, condensed -->
<!-- route: worldEditorEntity.descriptions -->

| Field | Who reads it | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Author's Brief** | Only the ✨ buttons | Your own notes. Nothing generates into it. |
| **Player-Facing Description** | The player, on the entity's card | Never sent to the AI, so it uses no context |
| **AI-Facing Description** | The AI | The full text. Put secrets here. |
| **AI-Facing Summary** | The AI | **Advanced mode only.** One line, for slots where the full text is too long. A blank summary is fine, and the game uses the full description in its place. |

The default prompt uses summaries for entities in *reachable* locations. It uses full descriptions for entities at the player's current location. So add a summary only when the entity shows up in reachable locations.

The **✨ toolbar** beside **AI-Facing Summary** can write a draft from your AI-Facing Description.

### The Author's Brief
<!-- keywords: author brief, notes, source, secret, regenerate, round trip -->

The brief sits above both descriptions. It holds your own notes, in any shape. A list is fine.

When the brief holds anything, both ✨ buttons draft from it. So you can regenerate either description as often as you like, and your facts stay as you wrote them. Start a line with *SECRET:* and the Player-Facing draft leaves it out. The AI-Facing draft keeps it.

Without a brief, each description is drafted from the other. That round trip loses things. The player-facing prompt leaves private material out, and the AI-facing prompt fills in what a blurb implies. So drafting one way and back can replace your secrets with what the model guessed. A ✨ that would replace text you already wrote asks first, and says how much goes.

The brief belongs to the world. A copy that follows a library item keeps its own brief through every update, and **Save to Library** leaves it behind.

### Checking the two descriptions
<!-- keywords: consistency, contradiction, disagree, check, magnifier -->

The **🔍** button beside **AI-Facing Description** reads both descriptions and reports where they disagree: a fact one states and the other contradicts, or a fact the player is shown that the AI-Facing Description never accounts for. It changes nothing. Every finding is yours to act on or ignore.

### Changing the drafting prompts

The wording behind the ✨ and 🔍 buttons is in **Settings → Prompts → Authoring** (Advanced mode): Player-Facing, AI-Facing, Summary and Description Check. Each has its own **Max Output Tokens**. Raise it if a draft stops mid-sentence. You edit them on a preset of your own, because the built-ins are read-only.

## Names and aliases
<!-- keywords: nickname, aka, other names, surname, not detected, wrong npc joins, false match, capitalization, name recognition -->

The game reads each page of narration to find which entities are present. It matches names and aliases.

**A name** matches this way:

| Name | Matches |
|---|---|
| One word, such as `Rose` | Only with a capital first letter. "She rose early" doesn't match. |
| Several words, such as `Emily Foster` | The words in order. One distinctive word with a capital also matches, so "Emily" is enough. A common word alone doesn't match. |
| Plurals | `Wolf` also matches "Wolves" |

**Aliases** are other names the entity uses: a title, a nickname, an epithet. Press Enter after each alias. The **Aliases** field shows in Advanced mode only, but aliases work in both modes. The AI reads them as *"also known as"*. The game also counts the entity as present when the narration uses an alias.

| Rule | Example |
|---|---|
| **Case-sensitive** | `Matron` matches "the Matron" and doesn't match "the matron". Add each form the narration can write. |
| **Plurals match** | `wolf` also matches "wolves" |
| **Whole words only** | `Em` doesn't match inside "System" |

> ⚠️ **Never start an alias with "the".** Narration often puts a title at the start of a sentence, and "The alpha…" doesn't match the alias `the alpha`. Write `alpha`, which matches in both positions.

Two more rules:

- **Don't use general job titles.** `knight`, `alchemist` or `apprentice` match every person of that trade, and the wrong entity joins the scene.
- **Don't use a role the story gives to someone absent.** Quoted dialogue is ignored, but plain narration isn't. If the prose says *"she was sent by the Warchief"*, the alias `Warchief` marks the Warchief as present.

## Locations
<!-- keywords: where npc lives, assign to place, put in room, vanished after delete, several places, too many npcs, crowded scene, orphaned -->

Each entity stores its own locations in one field. The location's **Entities** picker shows the same link from the other side. Set it from either side.

> ⚠️ **When you delete a location, each entity that was there loses it, and nothing warns you.** The entities stay. But an entity that was only in that location is now in no location, so it never reaches the AI again. The entity still looks fine on its own tab.

The default prompt sends entities from three places, as separate blocks: the player's **current location**, its **sub-locations**, and **reachable** locations.

> ⚠️ **Each entity at the player's location is sent on every turn.** A crowded location uses context all the time. Two or three entities that matter to the scene are better than a full village.

## Openings

An entity can have its own openings, so it can start the scene in its own voice. A playable entity can also have [Self Openings](World-Editor-Openings#self-openings), which start the game for a player who plays it. See [Entity Openings](World-Editor-Openings#entity-openings).

## Groups
<!-- keywords: folder for npcs, organize characters, sort cast, faction folders, nest folders -->

**Advanced mode only.** In Advanced mode, the **+** button's menu also has **Add Group**. Groups are folders for you. Nesting and order are for the editor only and **never reach the AI**. A group can't change the story.

## Images and models
<!-- keywords: portrait, character art, sprite, danbooru, stable diffusion prompt, mesh, face picture, png metadata -->

The image and the 3D model are for the player's screen. **Image Tags** are booru tags for AI [image generation](Image-Generation#scene-images) only. The ✨ toolbar can write a draft of the tags from the description. When you upload an image that has a prompt in its file, the editor offers to use that prompt. The narrator reads none of this.

An image field takes an uploaded file or a web address. See [Upload or link](World-Editor-Overview#upload-or-link).

## SillyTavern cards
<!-- keywords: field mapping, what converts, card fields, alternate greetings, example dialogue, v2 spec, user tag, char tag -->

Import a SillyTavern PNG or JSON card, and it becomes an entity. The card's description, personality and scenario become the **AI-Facing Description**. The card's greetings become [Entity Openings](World-Editor-Openings#entity-openings):

| On the card | Becomes |
|---|---|
| **First message** | The entity's first Opening Narration |
| Each **alternate greeting** | One more Opening Narration, in card order, at weight 1 |
| The name macro, `{{char}}` | The **Character Name** chip, in the entity's description and openings. In the card's lorebook, the entity's name as plain text. |
| The user macro, `{{user}}` | The [Player Name chip](Persona-Authoring#the-player-name-chip) |

When these openings are in the draw, **Re-generate** on page one shows another greeting, like a swipe in SillyTavern. A card with no first message and no alternate greetings imports with no openings.

> 💡 **The Character Name chip shows the entity's name, and it follows a rename.** Rename the entity, and its description and openings use the new name.

> 💡 **`{{user}}` stays in the stored text, as the Player Name chip.** The shown page says the persona's name, or "you" with no persona. The entity's descriptions and the card's lorebook keep the chip too, and there it reads "the player" with no persona.

## In the library
<!-- keywords: standalone character, edit outside world, reusable npc, my characters list, saved character editor, credit and labels -->
<!-- route: entityEditor -->

Open an entity in the library's **Entities** tab, and its editor has three tabs.

| Tab | What it holds |
|---|---|
| **Entity** | **Author** and **Tags** in a column on the left. On the right, the **Profile**, **Descriptions** and **Openings** tabs, with the same fields as the World Editor. |
| **Traits** | The entity's own [traits](World-Editor-Traits#entity-traits), across the full width. |
| **Placeholders** | The entity's own [placeholders](World-Editor-Placeholders), across the full width. |

The editor opens on **Entity** at **Profile**. The author and tags stay in view on all three of its tabs. On mobile, they show at the top of **Profile** only.

The library editor has no Simple or Advanced mode, so it always shows every tab and field. Its **Persona** control has two choices, **Cast** and **Playable**.
