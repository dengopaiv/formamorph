# Browser tests (Playwright)

A small suite that runs the real app in a real browser. It is **not** part of `npm test` — the four
gates stay fast, and this runs on its own.

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

First time on a machine (downloads the browser, ~115 MB):

```bash
npm run test:e2e:install
```

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Both viewports, headless |
| `npm run test:e2e -- --project=desktop` | One viewport |
| `npm run test:e2e -- --headed` | Watch it drive |
| `npm run test:e2e:ui` | Playwright's time-travel UI — the fastest way to debug a failure |

The runner starts its own dev server on **5183** (`--strictPort`), so it never fights the servers on
5180–5182. An already-running one on 5183 is reused; set `E2E_PORT` to move it.

Two more servers come up beside it, because the site is not the app: **5185** serves `hosting/`
statically for the landing page (`E2E_SITE_PORT`), and **5186** runs the account pages' own Vite entry
(`E2E_PAGES_PORT`). Specs against either navigate to an absolute URL rather than the baseURL.

## What belongs here

Only failures that a browser can see and jsdom structurally cannot:

- 📐 **Real layout** — element boxes, overlap, caret rects. jsdom reports every rect as zero.
- 🖱️ **Real hit-testing** — `pointer-events`, stacking, one thing covering another. A dispatched
  `click()` lands on a dead overlay just as happily as a live one.
- 📱 **Real viewport behavior** — anything gated on window size or touch.

Everything else is cheaper and clearer as a Vitest test. If a guard could be written against a pure
function or a rendered tree, write it there instead.

## Viewports

| Project | Size | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `desktop` | 1280 × 860 | The split layout only exists this wide |
| `mobile` | 375 × 812 | `hasTouch`, so touch-gated chrome renders |

Both projects run every spec; a spec that only makes sense on one calls `test.skip` on the project
name, which is why the run reports skips.

## Getting somewhere

Specs navigate with the DEV-only dev-router rather than clicking through menus:

```ts
await openApp(page);                       // seeded localStorage, past the intro and the setup gate
await openPromptEditor(page);              // Settings → Prompts, on an editable preset
await gotoDev(page, 'gameViewer', { tab: 'memory' });
```

Helpers live in [app.ts](e2e/app.ts). The router itself is [devRoutes.ts](src/lib/devRoutes.ts) — it
is stripped from production builds, which is why these tests need `npm run dev` and not `preview`.

> **Editable preset:** the shipped prompt presets are read-only, and a read-only editor takes no
> caret. `openPromptEditor` creates a user preset first, through the real UI.

## Coverage today

[prompt-editor.spec.ts](e2e/prompt-editor.spec.ts) — the prompt editor's layout, chrome gating, caret,
focus behavior, and dropdown scrolling. Each guard was verified by putting its bug back and watching the
test go red.

[tooltip-hover.spec.ts](e2e/tooltip-hover.spec.ts) — the themed tooltip on the Main Menu's view toggle:
hover opens it, moving to the neighbor opens that one through the shared instant window, and keyboard
focus opens the same tip. Desktop only for the two hover guards — a touch profile has no hover, and the
native `title` these replaced never showed there either.

> **No stopwatch.** The instant window is read off the popup's `data-instant`, not off elapsed time.
> Note that the provider's `timeout` does **not** control it: a direct move from one trigger to its
> neighbor hands over instantly whatever that value is. What makes them one group is the shared provider,
> so removing it is the mutation that turns this guard red.

[library-drag-parity.spec.ts](e2e/library-drag-parity.spec.ts) — the library board's drag, as twelve executable
rules. It is a **parity** suite: every rule was measured against the library as it stood before the tile board
landed, and the file is written against app-level observables only (thumbnail order by `alt`, bounding boxes,
the absence of a folder heading) so it runs unchanged on either implementation.

> **How to re-validate it.** Add a worktree at the commit before the tile board, junction `node_modules` into
> it, copy the two files across, and run:
>
> ```bash
> git worktree add --detach ../_parity 9beea58
> ```
>
> Then `cp e2e/tileDrag.ts e2e/library-drag-parity.spec.ts ../_parity/e2e/` and
> `E2E_PORT=5186 npx playwright test library-drag-parity` from inside it. Twenty-four pass, two skip — the same
> score the current code gets. A rule that only the new board can satisfy does not belong in this file.

Two claims about the old code turned out to be false once measured there, so they are **not** asserted.
Releasing away from the board did *not* commit nothing: `closestCenter` always returns its nearest droppable
however far the pointer is, so the tile landed beside whichever tile was closest. And the settle was *not* a
fade: the card's `transition-opacity` class was dead — `useSortable` writes an inline transform-only
`transition` that overrides it — so the released tile snapped to its slot and to full opacity in one frame.

[library-tiles.spec.ts](e2e/library-tiles.spec.ts) — the folder half: made from the tile's menu, filled and
emptied from it, arranged inside, and never touched by a drag.

Two caveats worth knowing:

- **Focus, not the keyboard.** There is no soft keyboard to drive, so the specs measure what *summons*
  one: who holds focus, and whether that opens or re-opens full screen. The keyboard-stuck-open loop
  itself is still only reachable on a real phone.
- **Wheel events, not `scrollTop`.** Radix drives its dropdown chevrons off its own scroll handling.
  Setting `scrollTop` from a script leaves exactly one chevron mounted and reproduces nothing;
  `mouse.wheel` reproduces the reflow (the list jumped 334 → 358px before the fix). Any future scroll
  spec has to use real input.

[site-pages.spec.ts](e2e/site-pages.spec.ts) — the formamorph.ai account pages: the login page inside a
phone's width with no horizontal overflow, the register page and the not-found fallback, the palette,
the shared Profile / Account Settings / Sign Out header at desktop and phone sizes, the one-time canceled
deletion notice, session/avatar sync, and site sign-out reaching open app and landing pages without reloads.

> **The palette guard reads the landing page, not a copy.** It opens `hosting/index.html` on 5185, reads
> `--bg` and `--accent` off it, and compares those to the computed ground and button fill on 5186. The
> tolerance is three channels, because the tokens the shadcn primitives read are whole-number HSL and
> cannot land on an arbitrary hex. Putting the app's own dark background back turns it red.

[session-sync.spec.ts](e2e/session-sync.spec.ts) — live cross-surface sessions: a real site sign-in reaches
the open app without a reload, app sign-out reaches the site, and smaller app-to-app cases directly guard
the storage listeners. The site-pages server proxies a second app below `/play/`, so every page shares the
same test origin and `localStorage` just as it does on formamorph.ai.

## The contest flow needs a server

[contest-entry.spec.ts](e2e/contest-entry.spec.ts) publishes a world into a running contest and finds it
again in the Contest tab — then, in a second flow, has an admin announce a podium with that entry on it
and checks the place badge reaches the author's own library. It is the one spec that talks to a real
[FormamorphServer](https://github.com/JakeJamesDev/FormamorphServer), so it **skips unless you point it at
one** — `npm run test:e2e` on a machine without one reports it as a skip, never a failure.

```bash
E2E_API_URL=http://localhost:8797/api npm run test:e2e -- --project=desktop
```

Setting `E2E_API_URL` hands that base to the dev server as `VITE_API_URL_DEV` and stops it reusing an
already-running one — a server started without the override still points at the live workshop, and
publishing a test world there is not a mistake worth risking. The spec also blocks every off-machine
request as a second belt.

### Seeding a scratch server

From a FormamorphServer checkout, against throwaway directories so your own local data is untouched
(the last line runs the server, so give it its own shell):

```bash
export DATA_DIR=/tmp/e2e/data DB_PATH=/tmp/e2e/data/e2e.db STORAGE_ROOT=/tmp/e2e/storage JWT_SECRET=e2e
ADMIN_USERNAME=e2eadmin ADMIN_PASSWORD=e2eadminpass node src/utils/initDb.js
PORT=8797 node src/server.js
```

Then log in as that admin and `POST /api/events` a contest whose `startsAt` is in the past and `endsAt`
in the future (`type: "contest"`, plus `title`, `bannerText`, `body`). The spec finds it through
`GET /api/events/active` and skips with a note if there isn't one.

Each flow registers its own account, because a contest takes one entry per creator — so the spec is
repeatable, but the server's credential limiter (20 per 15 minutes per IP) caps a debugging loop.

**The results half needs two more things**, and skips with a note when either is missing:

| Needs | Why | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| An **admin** account | Only admins may announce results, and never their own entry — moderators are refused | The seeding recipe's `e2eadmin`; override with `E2E_ADMIN_USERNAME` / `E2E_ADMIN_PASSWORD` |
| A contest that has not announced yet | The server refuses a second announcement | Seed a fresh contest for each run of this flow |

💡 With a second entry already in the contest, the flow awards this run's world **2nd place** rather
than 1st — gold is the one place a badge that ignored the podium would still get right.

## CI

Not wired into a workflow yet. `npm run test:e2e` is CI-ready (it retries once and reports in
GitHub's annotation format when `CI` is set), but it needs a `playwright install --with-deps
chromium` step, so adding it is a deliberate choice rather than a default.
