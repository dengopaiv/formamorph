# Browser tests (Playwright)

A small suite that runs the real app in a real browser. It is **not** part of `npm test` — the four
gates stay fast, and this runs on its own.

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

First time on a machine (downloads the browser, ~115 MB):

```bash
npm run test:e2e:install
```

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Both viewports, headless |
| `npm run test:e2e -- --project=desktop` | One viewport |
| `npm run test:e2e -- --headed` | Watch it drive |
| `npm run test:e2e:ui` | Playwright's time-travel UI — the fastest way to debug a failure |

The runner starts its own dev server on **5183** (`--strictPort`), so it never fights the servers on
5180–5182. An already-running one on 5183 is reused; set `E2E_PORT` to move it.

Two more servers come up beside it, because the site is not the app: **5185** serves `hosting/`
statically for the landing page (`E2E_SITE_PORT`), and **5186** runs the account pages' own Vite entry
(`E2E_PAGES_PORT`). Specs against either navigate to an absolute URL rather than the baseURL.

## What belongs here

Only failures that a browser can see and jsdom structurally cannot:

- 📐 **Real layout** — element boxes, overlap, caret rects. jsdom reports every rect as zero.
- 🖱️ **Real hit-testing** — `pointer-events`, stacking, one thing covering another. A dispatched
  `click()` lands on a dead overlay just as happily as a live one.
- 📱 **Real viewport behavior** — anything gated on window size or touch.

Everything else is cheaper and clearer as a Vitest test. If a guard could be written against a pure
function or a rendered tree, write it there instead.

## Viewports

| Project | Size | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `desktop` | 1280 × 860 | The split layout only exists this wide |
| `mobile` | 375 × 812 | `hasTouch`, so touch-gated chrome renders |

Both projects run every spec; a spec that only makes sense on one calls `test.skip` on the project
name, which is why the run reports skips.

## Getting somewhere

Specs navigate with the DEV-only dev-router rather than clicking through menus:

```ts
await openApp(page);                       // seeded localStorage, past the intro and the setup gate
await openPromptEditor(page);              // Settings → Prompts, on an editable preset
await gotoDev(page, 'gameViewer', { tab: 'memory' });
```

Helpers live in [app.ts](e2e/app.ts). The router itself is [devRoutes.ts](src/lib/devRoutes.ts) — it
is stripped from production builds, which is why these tests need `npm run dev` and not `preview`.

> **Editable preset:** the shipped prompt presets are read-only, and a read-only editor takes no
> caret. `openPromptEditor` creates a user preset first, through the real UI.

## Coverage today

[prompt-editor.spec.ts](e2e/prompt-editor.spec.ts) — the prompt editor's layout, chrome gating, caret,
focus behavior, and dropdown scrolling. Each guard was verified by putting its bug back and watching the
test go red.

[tooltip-hover.spec.ts](e2e/tooltip-hover.spec.ts) — the themed tooltip on the Main Menu's view toggle:
hover opens it, moving to the neighbor opens that one through the shared instant window, and keyboard
focus opens the same tip. Desktop only for the two hover guards — a touch profile has no hover, and the
native `title` these replaced never showed there either.

> **No stopwatch.** The instant window is read off the popup's `data-instant`, not off elapsed time.
> Note that the provider's `timeout` does **not** control it: a direct move from one trigger to its
> neighbor hands over instantly whatever that value is. What makes them one group is the shared provider,
> so removing it is the mutation that turns this guard red.

[chat-pin.spec.ts](e2e/chat-pin.spec.ts) — the Chat layout's scroll: a submit or Re-generate pins the turn to
the viewport top, the view holds still through a long stream, and Jump to Latest shows, lands, and hides. A
local server streams the reply in timed chunks, because `page.route` answers in one piece.

> **Frames, not seconds.** Motion and stillness are counts of frames in which the offset moved. Each guard
> was verified by putting its bug back and watching the test go red.

[library-drag-parity.spec.ts](e2e/library-drag-parity.spec.ts) — the library board's drag, as twelve executable
rules. It is a **parity** suite: every rule was measured against the library as it stood before the tile board
landed, and the file is written against app-level observables only (thumbnail order by `alt`, bounding boxes,
the absence of a folder heading) so it runs unchanged on either implementation.

> **How to re-validate it.** Add a worktree at the commit before the tile board, junction `node_modules` into
> it, copy the two files across, and run:
>
> ```bash
> git worktree add --detach ../_parity 9beea58
> ```
>
> Then `cp e2e/tileDrag.ts e2e/library-drag-parity.spec.ts ../_parity/e2e/` and
> `E2E_PORT=5186 npx playwright test library-drag-parity` from inside it. Twenty-four pass, two skip — the same
> score the current code gets. A rule that only the new board can satisfy does not belong in this file.

Two claims about the old code turned out to be false once measured there, so they are **not** asserted.
Releasing away from the board did *not* commit nothing: `closestCenter` always returns its nearest droppable
however far the pointer is, so the tile landed beside whichever tile was closest. And the settle was *not* a
fade: the card's `transition-opacity` class was dead — `useSortable` writes an inline transform-only
`transition` that overrides it — so the released tile snapped to its slot and to full opacity in one frame.

[library-tiles.spec.ts](e2e/library-tiles.spec.ts) — the folder half: made from the tile's menu, filled and
emptied from it, arranged inside, and never touched by a drag.

Two caveats worth knowing:

- **Focus, not the keyboard.** There is no soft keyboard to drive, so the specs measure what *summons*
  one: who holds focus, and whether that opens or re-opens full screen. The keyboard-stuck-open loop
  itself is still only reachable on a real phone.
- **Wheel events, not `scrollTop`.** Radix drives its dropdown chevrons off its own scroll handling.
  Setting `scrollTop` from a script leaves exactly one chevron mounted and reproduces nothing;
  `mouse.wheel` reproduces the reflow (the list jumped 334 → 358px before the fix). Any future scroll
  spec has to use real input.

[folder-fly-in.spec.ts](e2e/folder-fly-in.spec.ts) — the folder camera, in numbers. One recorder samples every
animation frame of a fly-in and a fly-out on a scrolled library: the folder tile's rectangle in the library
layer against the region's rectangle in the folder layer (one pixel apart, both directions), the sizes in
between, the header's opacity and lift, and the left-out members' one shared opacity. A second group proves
the clips in pixels. Each guard was verified by putting its fault back and watching the test go red.

> **A clip is only proved by painted truth.** `getBoundingClientRect` reports an element's own box and knows
> nothing about an ancestor's clip — a fix that widened one clip while an ancestor went on cutting at the
> identical line passed exactly such a check and changed nothing on screen. `elementFromPoint` is no use
> here either: the raised frame and the scroll viewport both carry `pointer-events: none` while the camera
> runs, so a hit test returns neither layer. So the clip tests pause the camera on a frame, photograph a
> strip, hide one layer, photograph the same strip again, and compare the two images.

[site-pages.spec.ts](e2e/site-pages.spec.ts) — the formamorph.ai account pages: the login page inside a
phone's width with no horizontal overflow, the register page and the not-found fallback, the palette,
the shared Profile / Account Settings / Sign Out header at desktop and phone sizes, the one-time canceled
deletion notice, session/avatar sync, and site sign-out reaching open app and landing pages without reloads.

> **The palette guard reads the landing page, not a copy.** It opens `hosting/index.html` on 5185, reads
> `--bg` and `--accent` off it, and compares those to the computed ground and button fill on 5186. The
> tolerance is three channels, because the tokens the shadcn primitives read are whole-number HSL and
> cannot land on an arbitrary hex. Putting the app's own dark background back turns it red.

[session-sync.spec.ts](e2e/session-sync.spec.ts) — live cross-surface sessions: a real site sign-in reaches
the open app without a reload, app sign-out reaches the site, and smaller app-to-app cases directly guard
the storage listeners. The site-pages server proxies a second app below `/play/`, so every page shares the
same test origin and `localStorage` just as it does on formamorph.ai.

[anonymous-likes.spec.ts](e2e/anonymous-likes.spec.ts) — the two places a guest gives a like. In the
community browser a press fills the heart and raises the count, and a reload finds it still filled,
because the Install id in `localStorage` is what the stub server keys its rows by. In a game, a world
downloaded from a listing asks once on the fifteenth turn, takes the like, and does not ask again. Each
guard was verified by putting its fault back and watching the test go red.

> **The fifteenth turn is reached by rebuilding the save, not by playing fifteen turns.** `buildLongSave`
> puts the `whiteRoom` fixture one turn short of `LIKE_PROMPT_TURNS`, so one scripted turn is the
> fifteenth. The fixture world is served with an id, and the download link (`sourceId`, `downloadedAt`)
> goes onto the stored record rather than into the world, because it is wrapper metadata.

> **A catch-all route over the API origin goes on first, so the named routes win.** Playwright matches
> the most recently added handler, so anything the catch-all sees is a request the spec did not expect,
> and it fails the run instead of reaching a real server. The origin comes from `E2E_API_URL` when the
> runner sets one, because a pattern pinned to the live host would match nothing under that override.

> **A card that paints nothing still passes `toBeVisible`.** `opacity: 0` keeps the box and the
> visibility, so the card and the heart are both photographed twice — once as they stand, once with the
> element hidden — and the two strips must differ. A hit test runs beside it for the other half: painted
> and covered are different failures.

## The contest flow needs a server

[contest-entry.spec.ts](e2e/contest-entry.spec.ts) publishes a world into a running contest and finds it
again in the Contest tab — then, in a second flow, an admin builds a **tied** podium in the Podium dialog
and the results are read back on the surfaces a player sees. It is the one spec that talks to a real
[FormamorphServer](https://github.com/JakeJamesDev/FormamorphServer), so it **skips unless you point it at
one** — `npm run test:e2e` on a machine without one reports it as a skip, never a failure.

```bash
E2E_API_URL=http://localhost:8797/api npm run test:e2e -- --project=desktop
```

Setting `E2E_API_URL` hands that base to the dev server as `VITE_API_URL_DEV` and stops it reusing an
already-running one — a server started without the override still points at the live workshop, and
publishing a test world there is not a mistake worth risking. The spec also blocks every off-machine
request as a second belt.

### Seeding a scratch server

From a FormamorphServer checkout, against throwaway directories so your own local data is untouched
(the last line runs the server, so give it its own shell):

```bash
export DATA_DIR=/tmp/e2e/data DB_PATH=/tmp/e2e/data/e2e.db STORAGE_ROOT=/tmp/e2e/storage JWT_SECRET=e2e
ADMIN_USERNAME=e2eadmin ADMIN_PASSWORD=e2eadminpass node src/utils/initDb.js
PORT=8797 node src/server.js
```

Then log in as that admin and `POST /api/events` a contest whose `startsAt` is in the past and `endsAt`
in the future (`type: "contest"`, plus `title`, `bannerText`, `body`). The spec finds it through
`GET /api/events/active` and skips with a note if there isn't one.

Each flow registers its own account, because a contest takes one entry per creator — so the spec is
repeatable, but the server's credential limiter (20 per 15 minutes per IP) caps a debugging loop.

**The results half needs three more things**, and skips with a note when any is missing:

| Needs | Why | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| An **admin** account | Only admins may announce results, and never their own entry — moderators are refused | The seeding recipe's `e2eadmin`; override with `E2E_ADMIN_USERNAME` / `E2E_ADMIN_PASSWORD` |
| A contest that has not announced yet | The server refuses a second announcement | Seed a fresh contest for each run of this flow |
| A **second entry** in that contest | A tie needs two worlds, and this run publishes one of them | Run the first flow against the same contest first — each run enters a fresh account's world |

The flow closes the contest itself, by moving its `endsAt` into the past through the admin API. Announcing
is offered on a contest that has stopped taking entries, and this run publishes into one that is still
open, so the window is moved rather than waited out.

💡 **The podium is 1, 1, 2 when the contest holds a third entry.** Two worlds share 1st, and the newest
other entry takes 2nd, so one run proves a shared place and a sole place. Run the first flow twice against
the contest to seed it. With only two entries the podium is 1, 1, and the run's `podium` annotation says
which one it built. The server must accept places with no gaps, or the 1, 1, 2 announce is refused.

⚠️ **Re-seed rather than reuse.** The entry flow's catalog assertion narrows the grid to this run's
author, and on a scratch server that has accumulated a few dozen listings across many runs it starts
missing the listing it just published — measured at roughly one failure in three past about twenty-five
entries, both before and after the catalog-sync work that landed beside this. On a server seeded fresh it
passes every time. So throw the database away between sessions instead of resetting the contest in place.

⚠️ **The credential budget.** This flow spends six of the server's twenty calls per quarter hour per
address: one admin token in `beforeAll`, the account it registers, that account's sign-in and API token,
the admin's sign-in for the dialog, and the author's sign-in again for the player surfaces. Two full runs
inside fifteen minutes will hit the limiter, and a limited admin login reads as a skip with a note.
Restarting the server clears the counter.

## CI

Not wired into a workflow yet. `npm run test:e2e` is CI-ready (it retries once and reports in
GitHub's annotation format when `CI` is set), but it needs a `playwright install --with-deps
chromium` step, so adding it is a deliberate choice rather than a default.
