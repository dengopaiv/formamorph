/**
 * Publishing a world into a running contest, end to end: sign in, publish with the entry switch on, and
 * find the listing in both the Contest tab and the catalog it also belongs to. Then the other half of a
 * contest's life — an admin builds a shared 1st place in the Podium dialog, announces it, and the result
 * reaches the band, the cards and the bar the author reads it on.
 *
 * This one needs a server. Every part of the entry — the switch's own visibility, the flag riding the
 * publish body, the tab reading the entries back — is covered against mocks in the unit suite; what no
 * mock can show is that those three agree with what the real API stores and returns. So the flow runs
 * against a local FormamorphServer and skips wherever there isn't one, which is most machines.
 *
 * ```bash
 * # a scratch server, its own database, an active contest seeded through the admin API
 * E2E_API_URL=http://localhost:8797/api npm run test:e2e -- --project=desktop
 * ```
 *
 * See [the README](e2e/README.md) for the full seeding recipe.
