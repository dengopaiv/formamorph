 * The themed tooltip replaced every native `title` in the app. Two of its three promises are pointer
 * promises, and jsdom has no pointer: it dispatches no real hover, runs no `:focus-visible` heuristic,
 * and loads none of the stylesheet the bubble is positioned by. The wrapper's jsdom test therefore
 * proves the accessibility contract and the focus path in isolation; hover-open and the shared
 * instant-open window need a browser.
 *
 * Surface: the Main Menu's Grid/Detailed view toggle — two icon-only controls side by side, both
 * wrapped in `Tip`, reachable with no server and no world loaded.
 *
 * Nothing here counts milliseconds. The instant window is read off `data-instant`, the state Base UI
 * publishes for exactly this: set when an open skipped the shared delay, absent when it waited. A
 * stopwatch assertion against a 400 ms delay would only manufacture flakes.
