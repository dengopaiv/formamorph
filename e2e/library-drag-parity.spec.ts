/**
 * The library board's drag behavior, as the flat grid did it.
 *
 * This is a parity suite, not a feature suite. Every rule below was measured against the library as it
 * stood before the tile board landed, by running this same file in a worktree checked out at that commit.
 * Anything it asserts, the old grid did; anything the old grid did not do, it does not assert. That is the
 * whole point: four attempts at "the drag feels right again" failed because parity was argued rather than
 * measured, so the definition now lives here as executable checks instead of in anyone's description.
 *
 * The selectors are deliberately app-level — thumbnail alt text, bounding boxes, the absence of a folder
 * heading — because they have to mean the same thing in both implementations. Nothing here knows whether
 * the board displaces a tile with a transform or with a grid slot, or whether the carried tile is the
 * element under the pointer or a portal following it.
 *
 * @see e2e/tileDrag.ts for the gesture and sampling helpers.
