/**
 * The folder camera, measured as numbers rather than watched.
 *
 * Two layers move as one camera: the library board zooms into the folder tile and fades, while the
 * folder board grows out of that tile to full size. The contract a player can see is that the tile's
 * picture and the board's picture are the same picture at every instant — so the folder tile's
 * rectangle in the library layer must equal the region's rectangle in the folder layer on every frame,
 * in both directions, and the sizes in between must be real intermediate sizes rather than a swap.
 *
 * jsdom reaches none of this: no layout, no animation clock, and nothing painted.
 *
 * **Clips are proved by pixels, never by a rectangle.** `getBoundingClientRect` reports an element's own
 * box and knows nothing about an ancestor's clip, and a fix that widened one clip while an ancestor went
 * on cutting at the identical line passed exactly such a check. `elementFromPoint` is out too: the raised
 * frame and the scroll viewport both carry `pointer-events: none` while the camera runs, so a hit test
 * returns neither layer and every clip assertion would pass for the wrong reason. So each clip claim here
 * pauses the camera on a frame, photographs a strip, hides one layer, photographs the same strip again,
 * and compares the two images. Identical means that layer painted nothing there.
